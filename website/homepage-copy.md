## 2. The Problem

**Section Label:** The Problem

**Headline:** You shouldn't have to choose between taking care of your people and protecting your bottom line.

### Card: For Employers
**Headline:** Most self-insured employers pay more every year for plans designed for insurance company profits
**Body:** Premiums rise 7-10% every year. At that rate, your healthcare spend doubles in a decade, and you're still getting the same legacy experience.

### Card: For Brokers
**Headline:** It's hard to stand out when every broker is selling the same plans
**Body:** 60% of brokers are now owned by private equity that won't innovate. Independent brokers need a product the competition can't match.

### Card: For Physicians
**Headline:** Insurance companies have stripped physicians of their agency
**Body:** Pre-authorizations, denials, and administrative overhead stand between doctors and their patients. Physicians should practice medicine, not fight paperwork.

## 3. Your Guide (Empathy + Authority)

**Section Label:** Your Guide

**Headline:** We've been on every side of this table.

### Quote
> "We know what renewal season feels like. We know the frustration of watching insurance companies extract value while delivering less. We've lived it."

### Authority Cards

**30+ Years Physician-Led**
Founded and led by physicians who understand healthcare from the inside out, not insurance executives chasing margins.

**Powered by Capital Rx**
Our technology partner gives your company access to Judi, the first platform to process medical and prescription claims together. Transparent data visibility instead of waiting months for your own reports.

**30+ Years of Operations**
Three decades of health plan operations: processing claims, building contracts, managing sales, and running the technical side of health plans.

**Physician-First Design**
Every plan feature starts with one question: does this let physicians practice medicine the way it should be practiced?

### Video Placeholder
**Title:** Our Story: Coming Soon
**Body:** A short video about why we started Vxtra Health and how we're changing healthcare for self-insured employers.

## 5. Our Town Model

**Section Label:** The Our Town Model

**Headline:** Augusta and Gainesville are the marketplace.

**Subhead:** Vxtra Health connects employers with the best local doctors in your community, powered by the same technology Fortune 100 companies use, so your team gets better care at lower costs.

### Hub
Vxtra Health (center)

### Spoke: Employers
**Title:** Augusta & Gainesville Employers
**Body:** Self-insured companies with 200-2,000 employees pool together for collective purchasing power and predictable costs.

### Spoke: Brokers
**Title:** Benefits Brokers
**Body:** Your broker brings a differentiated product that no competitor can match, protecting existing business and winning new clients.

### Spoke: Physicians
**Title:** Local Physicians
**Body:** The best independent doctors in your community, where the same treatment costs 40-70% less than a hospital system.

### Bottom Statement
In Augusta and Gainesville, **the dots are closer together**. Everyone knows everyone. We're building health insurance that works for the people who live and work here, not for insurance company shareholders.

## 7. The Outcome (Success)

**Section Label:** The Outcome

**Headline:** What happens when healthcare works the way it should.

### Card: Employers
**Subtitle:** Be the reason your company finally has health insurance it can be proud of
**Body:** Predictable, lower costs with transparent data visibility. Employees who say "my employer cares about me." Hero status to the board.

### Card: Employees
**Subtitle:** Be someone who actually uses their healthcare, without the stress
**Body:** $0 copays, $0 deductibles. A real relationship with their doctor. Care without dread.

### Card: Physicians
**Subtitle:** Practice medicine the way you always intended to
**Body:** Agency restored. Community-centered care. Independent practice in a community that knows your name.

## 8. The Stakes (Failure)

**Section Label:** The Stakes

**Headline:** The cost of doing nothing keeps going up.

### Risk 1: Premiums will keep rising
At 7%+ annually, your healthcare spend doubles in a decade. The math doesn't get friendlier with time.

### Risk 2: Your best people will leave
68% of employees say benefits are a top factor in staying. Subpar coverage drives top talent to competitors who invest in their people.

### Risk 3: Care quality will decline
When employees avoid care due to cost, small problems become expensive emergencies. Prevention is always cheaper than crisis.

**Closing:** Every year of inaction is another year of 1,600% stock appreciation for insurance companies, funded by your premiums.

## 9. Who We Help (Audience Routing)

**Section Label:** Who We Help

**Headline:** Built for everyone who touches healthcare.

### Card: Brokers
Brokers are all selling the same thing. Vxtra Health offers a plan built around the employer, the employee, and the physician, with transparent costs and a better experience for everyone. Your clients save real money, your book of business is protected, and employers come to you because you're the one with the plan that actually works.

### Card: Employers
Most self-insured employers are paying more every year for health plans designed for insurance company profits, not their people. Vxtra Health gives employers with 200 to 2,000 employees a physician-led health plan with transparent data, local physicians, and costs you can actually see and control. Your employees get better care and your costs go down by hundreds of dollars per employee per month.

### Card: Physicians
Vxtra Health puts physicians back in charge of patient care, working directly with local employers and their employees, supported by technology that handles claims and data so doctors can focus on medicine. Your patients trust you, not a call center. You make the clinical decisions.

### Card: Employees
Your employer has partnered with Vxtra Health to connect you with local physicians who actually know you, with lower out-of-pocket costs and none of the insurance runaround. You call your doctor, you get an appointment, you get the care you need, and you don't dread opening the bill.
