## 2. The Problem

**Section Label:** The Problem

**Headline:** It's exhausting trying to stand out when you're selling the same solutions as every other broker in town.

### Card: For Brokers
**Headline:** It's hard to stand out when every broker is selling the same plans
**Body:** 60% of brokers are now owned by private equity that won't innovate. Independent brokers need a product the competition can't match.

### Card: For Employers
**Headline:** Most self-insured employers pay more every year for plans designed for insurance company profits
**Body:** Premiums rise 7-10% every year. At that rate, your clients' healthcare spend doubles in a decade, and they're still getting the same legacy experience.

### Card: For Physicians
**Headline:** Insurance companies have stripped physicians of their agency
**Body:** Pre-authorizations, denials, and administrative overhead stand between doctors and their patients. Physicians should practice medicine, not fight paperwork.

## 3. Your Guide (Empathy + Authority)

**Section Label:** Your Guide

**Headline:** We've been on every side of this table.

### Quote
> "It's exhausting trying to stand out with the same solutions as every other broker in town. We've lived that frustration. We built something different."

### Authority Cards

**30+ Years Physician-Led**
Founded and led by physicians who understand healthcare from the inside out, not insurance executives chasing margins.

**Powered by Capital Rx**
Our technology partner gives your clients access to Judi, the first platform to process medical and prescription claims together. Transparent data visibility instead of waiting months for their own reports.

**30+ Years of Operations**
Three decades of health plan operations: processing claims, building contracts, managing sales, and running the technical side of health plans.

**Physician-First Design**
Every plan feature starts with one question: does this let physicians practice medicine the way it should be practiced?

### Video Placeholder
**Title:** Our Story: Coming Soon
**Body:** A short video about why we started Vxtra Health and how we're giving brokers a product the competition can't match.

## 5. Our Town Model

**Section Label:** The Our Town Model

### Spoke: Employers
**Title:** Augusta & Gainesville Employers
**Body:** Self-insured companies with 200-2,000 employees pool together for collective purchasing power and predictable costs. Your clients get better care at lower costs.

### Spoke: Physicians
**Title:** Local Physicians
**Body:** The best independent doctors in the community, where the same treatment costs 40-70% less than a hospital system. Your clients' employees get care from physicians they trust.

### Bottom Statement

## 7. The Outcome (Success)

**Section Label:** The Outcome

**Headline:** What happens when you offer something nobody else can.

### Card: Brokers
**Subtitle:** Be the broker who brings something nobody else can offer
**Body:** A product no competitor can match. Existing business secured. New business pipeline full. An improved experience for everyone your clients employ.

### Card: Employers
**Subtitle:** Be the reason your company finally has health insurance it can be proud of
**Body:** Your clients get predictable, lower costs with transparent data visibility. Their employees say "my employer cares about me." Hero status to the board.

### Card: Physicians
**Subtitle:** Practice medicine the way you always intended to
**Body:** Agency restored. Community-centered care. Independent practice in a community that knows your name.

---

## 8. The Stakes (Failure)

**Section Label:** The Stakes

**Headline:** The cost of waiting keeps going up.

### Risk 1: You could lose clients
When another broker brings Vxtra to your clients first, you're the one explaining why you didn't. Independent brokers who don't differentiate lose business to those who do.

### Risk 2: Revenue stagnates with limited differentiation
60% of brokers are now owned by private equity. If you're selling the same plans as everyone else, you're competing on relationship alone. That's not a strategy.

### Risk 3: Another agency could share Vxtra first
Vxtra is launching exclusively in Augusta and Gainesville. The broker who brings it to the market first wins. The one who waits loses the advantage.

**Closing:** Every year of inaction is another year of selling the same plans as every other broker in town while your clients pay more for less.

## 9. Who We Help (Audience Routing)

**Section Label:** Who We Help

**Headline:** Built for everyone who touches healthcare.

### Card: Employers
Most self-insured employers are paying more every year for health plans designed for insurance company profits, not their people. Vxtra Health gives employers with 200 to 2,000 employees a physician-led health plan with transparent data, local physicians, and costs you can actually see and control. Your employees get better care and your costs go down by hundreds of dollars per employee per month.

### Card: Physicians
Vxtra Health puts physicians back in charge of patient care, working directly with local employers and their employees, supported by technology that handles claims and data so doctors can focus on medicine. Your patients trust you, not a call center. You make the clinical decisions.

### Card: Employees
Your employer has partnered with Vxtra Health to connect you with local physicians who actually know you, with lower out-of-pocket costs and none of the insurance runaround. You call your doctor, you get an appointment, you get the care you need, and you don't dread opening the bill.
