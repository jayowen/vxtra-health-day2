## 2. The Problem

**Section Label:** The Problem

**Headline:** Nobody should dread going to the doctor because they're afraid of what it'll cost.

### Card: For Employees
**Headline:** Healthcare is confusing and way too expensive
**Body:** You put off appointments because you're worried about the bill. You avoid care because deductibles are too high. And when you do go, you feel like a number, not a person.

### Card: For Employers
**Headline:** Most self-insured employers pay more every year for plans designed for insurance company profits
**Body:** Your employer sees it too. Premiums rise every year, and the experience gets worse for everyone. That's why they partnered with Vxtra Health.

### Card: For Physicians
**Headline:** Insurance companies have stripped physicians of their agency
**Body:** Your doctor wants to focus on you, not paperwork. Pre-authorizations, denials, and administrative overhead stand between physicians and the care they want to give you.

**Headline:** What happens when you can actually use your healthcare.

## 8. The Stakes (Failure)

**Section Label:** The Stakes

**Headline:** Avoiding care doesn't make the problem go away.

### Risk 1: Small problems become emergencies
When you skip appointments because of cost, minor issues turn into major ones. Prevention is always less expensive and less painful than crisis.

### Risk 2: You dread every bill
The anxiety of not knowing what a visit will cost keeps you from getting the care you need. You shouldn't have to choose between your health and your wallet.

### Risk 3: You lose the relationship with your doctor
Insurance networks shuffle you between physicians who don't know your history. You deserve a doctor who knows you, not one who's reading your chart for the first time.

**Closing:** Your employer chose Vxtra Health so you don't have to make these tradeoffs. $0 copays, $0 deductibles, and local doctors who know your name.
