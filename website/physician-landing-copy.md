## 2. The Problem

**Section Label:** The Problem

**Headline:** You didn't spend a decade in training to fight pre-authorization forms and get told how to treat your own patients by someone who's never seen them.

### Card: For Physicians
**Headline:** Insurance companies have stripped physicians of their agency
**Body:** Pre-authorizations, denials, and administrative overhead stand between doctors and their patients. Physicians should practice medicine, not fight paperwork.

### Card: For Employers
**Headline:** Most self-insured employers pay more every year for plans designed for insurance company profits
**Body:** Premiums rise 7-10% every year. The employers in your community deserve better, and so do the patients you treat.

### Card: For Brokers
**Headline:** It's hard to stand out when every broker is selling the same plans
**Body:** 60% of brokers are now owned by private equity that won't innovate. The brokers bringing Vxtra to local employers are the ones creating real change.

## 3. Your Guide (Empathy + Authority)

**Section Label:** Your Guide

**Headline:** We've been on every side of this table.

**30+ Years Physician-Led**

Our technology partner handles claims processing and data through Judi, the first platform to process medical and prescription claims together. The technology works so you don't have to fight it.

**30+ Years of Operations**
Three decades of health plan operations: processing claims, building contracts, managing sales, and running the technical side of health plans.

**Physician-First Design**
Every plan feature starts with one question: does this let physicians practice medicine the way it should be practiced?

### Video Placeholder
**Title:** Our Story: Coming Soon
**Body:** A short video about why we started Vxtra Health and how we're putting physicians back in charge of patient care.

## 5. Our Town Model

**Section Label:** The Our Town Model

**Headline:** Augusta and Gainesville are the marketplace.

**Subhead:** Vxtra Health connects employers with the best local doctors in your community, powered by the same technology Fortune 100 companies use. You are the physician these employers and their employees trust with their care.

### Hub
Vxtra Health (center)

### Spoke: Physicians
**Title:** Local Physicians
**Body:** The best independent doctors in the community. You treat patients directly, without insurance company interference, and the same treatment costs 40-70% less than a hospital system.

### Spoke: Employers
**Title:** Augusta & Gainesville Employers
**Body:** Self-insured companies with 200-2,000 employees pool together for collective purchasing power. Their employees are your patients, and they're coming to you because their plan sends them to the best local doctors.

### Spoke: Brokers
**Title:** Benefits Brokers
**Body:** Local brokers bring employers to the Vxtra network. They're the ones connecting the employers in your community with a plan that values independent physicians.

### Bottom Statement
In Augusta and Gainesville, **the dots are closer together**. Everyone knows everyone. Vxtra is building health insurance that works for the physicians, employers, and employees who live and work here, not for insurance company shareholders.

## 7. The Outcome (Success)

**Section Label:** The Outcome

**Headline:** What happens when physicians lead healthcare again.

### Card: Physicians
**Subtitle:** Practice medicine the way you always intended to
**Body:** Agency restored. Community-centered care. Independent practice in a community that knows your name. You make the clinical decisions, and your patients trust you.

### Card: Employers
**Subtitle:** Be the reason your company finally has health insurance it can be proud of
**Body:** Predictable, lower costs with transparent data visibility. Employees who say "my employer cares about me." Hero status to the board.

**Body:** $0 copays, $0 deductibles. A real relationship with their doctor. Care without dread.

## 8. The Stakes (Failure)

**Section Label:** The Stakes

**Headline:** The cost of doing nothing keeps going up.

### Risk 1: More pre-authorizations, less autonomy
Insurance companies are tightening controls every year. Every renewal cycle adds more administrative overhead and takes more clinical decision-making out of your hands.

### Risk 2: 80% of hospital-employed physicians want out
Hospital systems are buying up specialists and independent practices. Physician pay is down 33% since 2001. The window to maintain independence is narrowing.

### Risk 3: Your patients are avoiding care
When patients dread the cost of a visit, small problems become expensive emergencies. The insurance system is failing the people you trained to help.

**Closing:** Every year of inaction is another year of insurance companies standing between you and your patients.

## 9. Who We Help (Audience Routing)

**Section Label:** Who We Help

**Headline:** Built for everyone who touches healthcare.

### Card: Employers
Most self-insured employers are paying more every year for health plans designed for insurance company profits, not their people. Vxtra Health gives employers with 200 to 2,000 employees a physician-led health plan with transparent data, local physicians, and costs you can actually see and control. Your employees get better care and your costs go down by hundreds of dollars per employee per month.

### Card: Brokers
Brokers are all selling the same thing. Vxtra Health offers a plan built around the employer, the employee, and the physician, with transparent costs and a better experience for everyone. Your clients save real money, your book of business is protected, and employers come to you because you're the one with the plan that actually works.

### Card: Employees
Your employer has partnered with Vxtra Health to connect you with local physicians who actually know you, with lower out-of-pocket costs and none of the insurance runaround. You call your doctor, you get an appointment, you get the care you need, and you don't dread opening the bill.
