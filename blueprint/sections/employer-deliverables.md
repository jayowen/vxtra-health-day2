# Vxtra Health — Employer Deliverables

*Blueprint Section | Prepared Feb 11, 2026*
*Business Builders for Vxtra Health*

---

## SECTION A: Employer Landing Page Strategic Wireframe

The employer landing page copy already exists as the main Vxtra Health homepage (`index-v2.html`). This page serves as both the "Air Traffic Control" page (routing all four audiences) AND the primary employer conversion page. Below is a top-to-bottom wireframe documenting each section block as built.

---

### BLOCK 1: Fixed Navigation Bar

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Content Type** | Persistent top nav, fixed on scroll |
| **Left** | Vxtra Health logo (color version) |
| **Center Links** | How It Works, Our Town, Who We Help, Our Story |
| **Right Actions** | "See How It Works" (teal outline button), "Schedule a Call" (coral solid button) |
| **Behavior** | Transparent over hero on load; white background with blur on scroll; mobile hamburger menu |
| **Design Notes** | Scrolled state swaps text/button colors from white to ink/teal. Mobile menu is full-screen overlay with same links plus dual CTA buttons. |

---

### BLOCK 2: Hero Section (The Character)

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Content Type** | Full-viewport hero with split layout (copy left, visual right) |
| **Badge** | Pill badge: "Now Launching in Augusta & Gainesville, GA" with animated pulse dot |
| **Headline** | "Health insurance costs are crushing your business. *We built a way out.*" |
| **Sub-copy** | "Vxtra Health is bringing physician-led health plans exclusively to self-insured employers in Augusta and Gainesville, Georgia -- powered by Fortune 100 technology, local physicians, and costs you can actually see and control." |
| **Primary CTA** | "Schedule a Call" (coral, large) |
| **Secondary CTA** | "See How It Works" (teal outline, large) |
| **Visual** | Organic-shaped photo carousel (3 rotating images: diverse professionals/employees). Morphing blob border radius animation. |
| **Floating Cards** | Two glassmorphism stat cards over the photo: "$0 Copays & Deductibles" and "30+ Years of Innovation" |
| **Background** | Dark ink gradient with animated organic teal/coral shapes |
| **Design Notes** | Apple-style simplicity. Low cognitive load. The headline IS the PEACE "Problem" statement. The italicized "We built a way out" uses teal for visual emphasis. Dark background conveys gravitas and corporate credibility. |

---

### BLOCK 3: Proof Bar (Social Proof Strip)

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Content Type** | Full-width horizontal bar anchored to bottom of hero |
| **Items** | Three proof points with icons: "30+ Years -- Physician-Led Experience" | "$0 Copays & Deductibles -- For Every Member" | "Augusta & Gainesville -- Exclusive Launch Markets" |
| **Design Notes** | Subtle teal background gradient. Acts as a visual bridge between hero and problem section. Reinforces three key differentiators before the visitor scrolls. |

---

### BLOCK 4: Problem Section (The Villain)

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Content Type** | PEACE "Empathy" block -- three-column problem cards on dark background |
| **Section Label** | "The Problem" |
| **Section Title** | "You shouldn't have to choose between taking care of your people and protecting your bottom line." |
| **Card 1 -- Employers** | "Most self-insured employers pay more every year for plans designed for insurance company profits." Sub-text: premiums rise 7-10%/year, spend doubles in a decade. |
| **Card 2 -- Brokers** | "Every broker in town is selling the same carriers and the same products." Sub-text: 60% PE-owned, independents need differentiation. |
| **Card 3 -- Physicians** | "Insurance companies have stripped physicians of their agency." Sub-text: pre-auths, denials, paperwork blocking patient care. |
| **Design Notes** | Dark (ink) background with coral accent borders on hover. Each card has a labeled audience type ("For Employers," "For Brokers," "For Physicians"). This section names the villain without naming specific insurance companies (Cigna constraint). Coral color = danger/urgency. |

---

### BLOCK 5: Guide Section (Empathy + Authority)

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Content Type** | Warm-white background. Empathy quote + authority proof grid + video placeholder. |
| **Section Label** | "Your Guide" |
| **Section Title** | "We've been on every side of this table." |
| **Larry Quote Block** | Photo placeholder (headshot needed) + blockquote: "We know what renewal season feels like. We know the frustration of watching insurance companies extract value while delivering less. We've lived it." -- Larry Hightower, Co-Founder & CEO |
| **Authority Grid** | 4 cards in 2x2 grid: |
| | 1. "30+ Years Physician-Led" -- founded by physicians, not insurance executives |
| | 2. "Powered by Capital Rx" -- Judi platform, transparent data, medical + Rx claims together |
| | 3. "Sandra's 30+ Years" -- health plan operations, claims, contracts, sales |
| | 4. "Physician-First Design" -- every feature starts with physician autonomy |
| **Video Placeholder** | "Our Story -- Coming Soon" -- placeholder for 3-5 minute brand story video |
| **Design Notes** | This section positions Vxtra as the guide (StoryBrand framework). Empathy first (the quote), then authority (the proof cards). Video placement is intentional -- belongs in "enlightenment" phase, not top-of-funnel. Teal left-border on quote block signals trust. |

---

### BLOCK 6: Plan Section (3 Steps)

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Content Type** | Centered header + three horizontal step cards with photos |
| **Section Label** | "The Plan" |
| **Section Title** | "Three steps to benefits that actually work." |
| **Step 1** | "Schedule a Conversation" -- Tell us what's not working. No pitch, no pressure. (Photo: business conversation) |
| **Step 2** | "Get a Custom Plan Design" -- Physician-led team designs: $0 copays, $0 deductibles, zero pre-auth. (Photo: plan design work) |
| **Step 3** | "Take Control of Your Health Plan" -- Costs stabilize, employees access benefits, physicians focus on medicine. (Photo: happy people) |
| **CTA** | "Schedule Your Conversation" (coral, large) |
| **Design Notes** | Numbered steps (1, 2, 3) with large step indicators. Each step has a relevant photo above the copy. This is the StoryBrand "plan" that reduces perceived risk. Language deliberately avoids jargon. The CTA repeats the first step to close the loop. |

---

### BLOCK 7: Our Town Model (The Marketplace)

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Content Type** | Hub-and-spoke visual diagram with explanation cards |
| **Section Label** | "The Our Town Model" |
| **Section Title** | "Augusta and Gainesville are the marketplace." |
| **Section Subtitle** | "Vxtra Health connects employers with the best local doctors in your community -- powered by the same technology Fortune 100 companies use -- so your team gets better care at lower costs." |
| **Hub** | Central "Vxtra Health" node with animated concentric rings |
| **Spoke 1 -- Employers** | "Augusta & Gainesville Employers" -- Self-insured, 200-2,000 employees, collective purchasing power |
| **Spoke 2 -- Brokers** | "Benefits Brokers" -- Differentiated product, protect existing business, win new clients |
| **Spoke 3 -- Physicians** | "Local Physicians" -- Best independent doctors, same treatment 40-70% less than hospital |
| **Bottom Statement** | "In Augusta and Gainesville, the dots are closer together. Everyone knows everyone. We're building health insurance that works for the people who live and work here -- not for insurance company shareholders." |
| **Design Notes** | This is a visual representation of the "Our Town" model -- the core differentiator. The hub-and-spoke layout communicates the aggregation concept without explaining the mechanics ("don't tell them how to build the watch"). Connector lines animate on scroll. The phrase "the dots are closer together" is Larry's language for why secondary markets work. |

---

### BLOCK 8: Comparison Table (The Difference)

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Content Type** | Side-by-side comparison table (traditional plans vs. Vxtra Health) |
| **Section Label** | "The Difference" |
| **Section Title** | "This is what 'better' looks like." |
| **Rows** | 7 comparison rows with red X (traditional) and green check (Vxtra): |
| | Copays on every visit vs. $0 copays |
| | High deductibles vs. $0 deductibles |
| | Pre-authorization required vs. No pre-authorization |
| | Months-old data vs. Transparent data visibility |
| | Misaligned incentives vs. Physician-aligned care |
| | 7-10% annual increases vs. Hundreds per employee per month in savings |
| | Employees avoid care vs. Employees get care |
| **Design Notes** | Clean, scannable format. Uses dollar amounts per messaging rules ("hundreds per employee per month" not percentages). Red/green visual shorthand makes the value proposition instantly clear. This is the PEACE "Answer" expressed as a comparison. |

---

### BLOCK 9: Success Section (The Outcome)

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Content Type** | Three photo-topped cards showing transformation for each audience |
| **Section Label** | "The Outcome" |
| **Section Title** | "What happens when healthcare works the way it should." |
| **Card 1 -- Employers** | "Become the leader who finally fixed healthcare for your company." Predictable lower costs, transparent data, hero status to the board. (Photo: confident professional) |
| **Card 2 -- Employees** | "Be someone who actually uses their healthcare -- without the stress." $0 copays, real doctor relationship, no dread. (Photo: happy diverse group) |
| **Card 3 -- Physicians** | "Practice medicine the way you always intended to." Agency restored, no pre-auths, independent practice. (Photo: smiling physician) |
| **Design Notes** | Each card's subtitle IS the PEACE "Change" statement (aspirational identity). The copy delivers the "End Result." Photos show real people in the transformed state. This paints the picture of success that makes the dream believable. |

---

### BLOCK 10: Failure Section (The Stakes)

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Content Type** | Numbered risk items with a closing statement |
| **Section Label** | "The Stakes" |
| **Section Title** | "The cost of doing nothing keeps going up." |
| **Risk 1** | "Premiums will keep rising" -- 7%+ annually, spend doubles in a decade |
| **Risk 2** | "Your best people will leave" -- 68% cite benefits as top factor |
| **Risk 3** | "Care quality will decline" -- avoidance leads to expensive emergencies |
| **Closing Line** | "Every year of inaction is another year of 1,600% stock appreciation for insurance companies -- funded by your premiums." |
| **Design Notes** | This is the StoryBrand "failure" section -- what happens if the hero does NOT act. Three numbered risks create escalating stakes. The closing line names the villain's profit motive without naming specific companies (Cigna constraint compliant). Positioned AFTER the success section so the visitor sees the dream first, then the cost of inaction. |

---

### BLOCK 11: Audience Routing (Who We Help)

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Content Type** | Four photo-topped audience cards with detailed copy |
| **Section Label** | "Who We Help" |
| **Section Title** | "Built for everyone who touches healthcare." |
| **Card 1 -- Brokers** (Emphasized/larger) | Independent broker value prop. Exclusive physician-led plan, Fortune 100 tech competitors don't have, clients save real money. |
| **Card 2 -- Employers** | Self-insured, 200-2,000 employees. Physician-led plan, transparent data, local physicians, costs down hundreds per employee per month. |
| **Card 3 -- Physicians** | Back in charge of patient care. Direct work with employers. Technology handles claims so physicians focus on medicine. |
| **Card 4 -- Employees** | Connected to local physicians who know them. Lower costs, no runaround. Call, get seen, get care, no dread. |
| **Design Notes** | This is the "Air Traffic Control" routing section. Brokers are intentionally emphasized (larger card) because they are the FIRST hero -- the gateway to employers. Each card uses the audience-specific one-liner copy. In future, each card will link to a dedicated landing page. Currently all drive to the single CTA. |

---

### BLOCK 12: Final CTA Section

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Content Type** | Full-width dark/gradient CTA section |
| **Section Label** | "Take the First Step" |
| **Section Title** | "Become the leader who finally fixed healthcare for your company." |
| **Sub-copy** | "Vxtra Health is launching exclusively in Augusta and Gainesville, Georgia. No pitch, no pressure -- just an honest conversation about your challenges and whether Vxtra is the right fit." |
| **Primary CTA** | "Schedule a Call" (white solid button, links to mailto:info@vxtrahealth.com) |
| **Secondary CTA** | "Download Our Overview" (white outline button, links to mailto for now) |
| **Tertiary** | "Or email us directly at info@vxtrahealth.com" |
| **Design Notes** | Repeats the PEACE "Change" statement as the headline. Three levels of CTA give different commitment levels (call > download > email). The "no pitch, no pressure" language reduces friction. Currently all CTAs link to email (placeholder until Calendly/HubSpot form is built). This section's background gradient matches the hero for visual bookending. |

---

### BLOCK 13: Footer

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Content Type** | Four-column footer |
| **Brand Column** | Logo, tagline ("Physician-led health plans for self-insured employers in Augusta & Gainesville, GA"), HQ address (2700 Cumberland Pkwy, Suite 140, Atlanta, GA 30339) |
| **Company Links** | Our Story, Our Town Model |
| **Learn More Links** | How It Works, Who We Help |
| **Connect Links** | Schedule a Call, Contact Us |
| **Bottom Bar** | Copyright 2026, Privacy Policy, Terms of Service |

---

### Page-Level Notes

- **StoryBrand Alignment:** The page follows the full 7-part StoryBrand framework in order: Character (hero), Problem (villain), Guide (empathy + authority), Plan (3 steps), Success (outcome), Failure (stakes), CTA (call to action).
- **PEACE Framework Integration:** The employer PEACE #1 (cost-focused) is embedded across the page: P = hero headline, E = problem section title, A = comparison table + Our Town model, C = success card subtitles, E = success card body copy.
- **Scroll Reveal:** All content blocks use scroll-triggered fade-in animations for progressive disclosure.
- **Mobile Responsive:** Full mobile menu, stacked layouts, responsive typography (clamp functions).
- **Cigna Constraint Compliant:** No insurance companies are named. Language is pro-employer/pro-transparency, not anti-insurer.
- **Messaging Rules Followed:** "Physician" used throughout (never "provider"). "Health insurance" framing (never "healthcare is broken"). Dollar amounts used where possible.

## SECTION B: Employer Targeted Marketing Strategy

*Converting self-insured employers (200-2,000 employees) in Augusta, GA (July 2026) and Gainesville, GA (July 2027)*

---

### 1. Conversion Funnel

The employer conversion funnel operates through four stages. The broker is the primary facilitator at every stage -- Vxtra does not go direct to employers without broker involvement.

#### Stage 1: AWARENESS
*"I didn't know there was another option."*

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Goal** | Make self-insured employers in Augusta and Gainesville aware that an alternative to traditional health insurance administration exists |
| **Channels** | Larry's LinkedIn thought leadership, broker conversations, civic group presentations (Rotary, Chamber of Commerce), remarketing ads, local business press |
| **Content** | Problem-focused: "Health insurance costs are crushing your business" messaging, industry stats (7-10% annual increases, 1,600% insurance stock appreciation), FAQ videos |
| **Key Touchpoints** | Larry speaks at Augusta Rotary/Chamber; Kelly and Salem mention Vxtra in existing client conversations; LinkedIn posts reach healthcare executives; website remarketing tags visitors |
| **Conversion Event** | Visits vxtrahealth.com OR broker introduces Vxtra in a client meeting |

#### Stage 2: INTEREST
*"Tell me more about how this works."*

| Element | Detail |

| **Content** | Proof-focused: Custom ROI projection using employer's census data, Capital Rx case studies, Tokyo Marine HCC backing, Larry's track record (22x and 15x exits, urology practice growth) |
| **Key Touchpoints** | Discovery call with Larry/Sandra; census data submitted for analysis; custom plan design delivered; employer talks to another employer who is also evaluating (the "dancing guy" effect) |
| **Conversion Event** | Employer receives custom plan design and ROI projection |

#### Stage 4: DECISION
*"I'm ready to move forward."*

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Goal** | Secure letter of intent and begin onboarding |
| **Channels** | Broker-led close, Larry/Sandra support, legal review |
| **Content** | Commitment-focused: Letter of intent template, onboarding timeline, implementation roadmap, employee communication plan |

---

### 3. Email Nurture Sequence

Triggered after any lead magnet capture. 7-email sequence over 21 days. All emails come from Larry Hightower (personal, not brand@).

#### Email 1: Welcome + The Problem (Day 0)
- **Subject Line:** "The math on health insurance isn't getting friendlier"
- **Key Message:** Thank them for downloading/registering. Restate the core problem: costs are rising 7-10% annually, doubling in a decade. Acknowledge the frustration -- "We know renewal season feels like a gut punch." Brief intro to Vxtra and the Our Town model.
- **CTA:** "Reply to this email with your biggest health insurance frustration"
- **Tone:** Empathetic, personal, conversational

#### Email 2: The Villain (Day 3)
- **Subject Line:** "Where your health insurance premiums actually go"
- **Key Message:** The 1,600% insurance stock appreciation stat. The fact that insurance companies are administrators for self-funded plans, not risk-bearers -- yet they still extract massive fees. Hospital administrators grew 2,500% vs. 100% physician growth. Frame the systemic misalignment without naming specific insurers (Cigna constraint).
- **CTA:** Link to FAQ video: "Why do health insurance costs keep going up?"
- **Tone:** Educational, factual, controlled frustration

#### Email 3: The Technology Story (Day 6)
- **Subject Line:** "Your company deserves Fortune 100 benefits"
- **Key Message:** Introduce Capital Rx and the Judi platform. Transparent data in 30 days or less ( vs. 120-day industry standard). First platform to process medical and Rx claims together. NADAC drug pricing. "Until now, this technology was only available to the largest companies in the world. Vxtra Health brings it to employers with 200 to 2,000 employees."
- **CTA:** Link to cost calculator tool
- **Tone:** Optimistic, forward-looking, credibility-building

#### Email 4: The Our Town Model (Day 9)
- **Subject Line:** "In Augusta, the dots are closer together"
- **Key Message:** Explain how the Our Town model works in plain language. Local independent physicians (same treatment, 40-70% less than hospital systems). Collective purchasing power when employers pool together. "People like us do things like this" community messaging. Name Augusta specifically.
- **CTA:** "See how employers in Augusta are coming together" (link to Our Town section of website)
- **Tone:** Community-driven, warm, local pride

#### Email 5: The Employee Experience (Day 13)
- **Subject Line:** "What if your employees actually loved their health plan?"
- **Key Message:** Introduce Vxtra Care (care orchestration/concierge). $0 copays, $0 deductibles, no pre-authorization. Personal nurse navigation -- employee leaves the doctor, calls Vxtra Care, and everything gets scheduled. "68% of employees say benefits are a top factor in staying. This is how you keep your best people."
- **CTA:** "Schedule a conversation about what this looks like for your team"
- **Tone:** Aspirational, employee-centric, vision-casting

#### Email 6: Social Proof + Urgency (Day 17)
- **Subject Line:** "Augusta employers are already asking about this"
- **Key Message:** Without naming specific employers, communicate momentum: "We're having conversations with employers across Augusta right now. The July 2026 launch window is approaching, and the collective pool is forming." Reference the 5,000 covered lives threshold. "The earlier your company joins, the stronger the pool becomes for everyone."
- **CTA:** "Request your free cost analysis"
- **Tone:** Momentum, community, urgency without pressure

#### Email 7: Direct Ask (Day 21)
- **Subject Line:** "One conversation. No commitment."
- **Key Message:** The direct ask. "I'd like to schedule a 30-minute conversation with you and your broker. No pitch, no pressure -- just an honest look at whether Vxtra is the right fit for your company." Restate the transformation: "From feeling trapped every renewal cycle to having a plan your employees love and costs you can actually control."
- **CTA:** "Schedule a Call" (link to Calendly/scheduling tool)
- **Tone:** Direct, confident, low-pressure

#### Sequence Notes:
- If recipient clicks "Schedule a Call" at any point, remove from nurture and move to qualified pipeline
- If recipient downloads the cost analysis lead magnet, skip to Email 5 (they've already engaged with the problem/solution)
- After Email 7, move to monthly newsletter list (not dead -- just not ready yet)
- All emails should be plain-text style (no heavy HTML templates) -- feels like a real email from Larry

---

### 4. Broker-Facilitated Conversion Strategy

Brokers are the gateway to employers. Vxtra never goes direct. The broker relationship is protected and compensated (3-year contracts, 40% upfront commissions).

#### Augusta Market: Kelly and Salem

Kelly and Salem have completed 1.5 years of groundwork in Augusta. They are at 8/10 readiness. Their approach is unique and critical to the go-to-market strategy:

**Multi-Employer Table Strategy**
Kelly's approach is to bring multiple employers to the table at once -- not one-by-one selling. This is foundational to the Our Town model because:
- Employers see peer validation immediately ("I'm not the only one considering this")
- Collective volume triggers better stop-loss pricing from Jay Richie / Tokyo Marine HCC
- Accelerates the path to 5,000 covered lives threshold
- Reduces individual employer risk perception ("If Company X is in, this must be real")

**The "Dancing Guy" Approach**
The first employer to sign is the leader. The second employer validates. Then momentum builds naturally. Kelly and Salem facilitate this through:
- Golf course introductions between business owners
- Owner-to-owner peer conversations ("Let me tell you what I'm looking at for our health plan")
- Informal selling that's already happening: "I already told three people about this"
- Civic group overlap (Rotary, Chamber members who are also employer decision-makers)

**Broker Enablement Materials (What Kelly and Salem Need)**
1. Single-page sales sheet -- outcome-focused, not operational detail ("don't tell them how to build the watch")
2. Qualification checklist -- 100+ employees on plan, self-insured 2+ years, census data process
3. Objection response guide -- top 10 employer objections with StoryBrand-aligned responses
4. Employer introduction email template -- broker sends to client with Vxtra overview
5. Discovery call scheduling link -- broker books the three-way with Vxtra directly

#### Gainesville Market: Bart and Sam

Bart and Sam are the broker pair for Gainesville (July 2027 launch). Sam is a former 2-term mayor of Gainesville, which provides significant advantages:

**Sam's Community Influence**
- Known by virtually every business owner and civic leader in Gainesville
- Former mayoral role gives inherent credibility and trust
- Can open doors that cold outreach never could
- Natural convener -- can host employer dinners, roundtables, informal gatherings
- His endorsement carries weight equivalent to institutional backing in a secondary market

**Gainesville Strategy (Starting H2 2026)**
1. Sam and Bart begin informal conversations with top employer targets Q3-Q4 2026
2. Use Augusta as the proof case: "Here's what's happening in Augusta right now"
3. Host an employer roundtable dinner in Gainesville (Q1 2027) -- Sam convenes, Larry presents
4. Target letters of intent by spring 2027 for July 1, 2027 launch
5. Leverage Augusta operating metrics and employer testimonials as proof

#### Broker Conversion Process (Both Markets)

```
Step 1: Broker identifies qualified employer from existing book of business
        (self-insured, 100+ on plan, 2+ years self-funded)

Step 2: Broker introduces Vxtra concept in next client meeting or
        renewal conversation ("I have something new to show you")

Step 3: Broker sends employer introduction email with Vxtra overview
        and link to website / lead magnet

Step 4: Broker schedules three-way discovery call
        (broker + employer + Larry/Sandra)

Step 5: Employer submits census data for free cost analysis

Step 6: Vxtra delivers custom plan design and ROI projection

Step 7: Broker facilitates peer-to-peer conversations with
        other employers in the market ("dancing guy" momentum)

Step 8: Employer signs letter of intent

Step 9: Onboarding begins (60-90 days before go-live)
```

### 5. Content Strategy

#### LinkedIn (Larry Hightower's Personal Account)

Larry's personal LinkedIn is the primary content channel for the first 12 months. Personal thought leadership outperforms company pages, especially for a pre-revenue startup where the founder's credibility IS the brand.

**Posting Cadence:** 3x per week (Mon, Wed, Fri)

**Content Pillars:**

| Pillar | % of Posts | Example Topics |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| Industry Education | 40% | Why costs keep rising, how self-funding actually works, what 120-day data delays mean, hospital vs. independent physician costs |
| Vision / Our Town | 25% | The Our Town model, why secondary markets matter, what "Fortune 100 technology for everyone" means, the future of employer health plans |
| Authority / Credibility | 20% | Larry's career story, Capital Rx partnership news (ride the IPO wake), Sandra's operations expertise, Tokyo Marine HCC investment |
| Engagement / Community | 15% | Polls ("What's your biggest health insurance frustration?"), questions, commenting on industry news, celebrating Augusta/Gainesville community |

**Sample Post Concepts:**
1. "I'm 74 years old, and I'm starting a new company. Here's why." (personal story)
2. "Your health insurance company made 1,600% stock returns in 8 years. You paid for it." (industry stat)
3. "The same treatment costs 40-70% more at a hospital than an independent physician. Why?" (education)
4. "What if 20 employers in Augusta pooled together for health insurance? That's what we're building." (Our Town)
5. "Capital Rx just partnered with [Fortune 100 company]. Here's what that means for employers with 200 employees." (ride the wake)

#### Blog / Website Content

### 6. Remarketing Strategy

Tag every website visitor and serve follow-up educational content across platforms. This is low-cost, high-impact for an early-stage company building awareness in two specific markets.

#### Implementation

1. **Pixel Installation:** Meta (Facebook/Instagram) pixel + LinkedIn Insight Tag + Google Ads remarketing tag on vxtrahealth.com
2. **Audience Segmentation:**
   - All website visitors (broad)
   - Visited "How It Works" section (engaged)
   - Visited "Schedule" section but didn't convert (high intent)
   - Downloaded a lead magnet (qualified)
3. **Geographic Targeting:** Augusta-Richmond County MSA and Gainesville-Hall County MSA (tight geographic focus)
4. **Budget:** $500-1,000/month initially (small market, targeted audience)

#### Ad Content by Audience Segment

| Segment | Ad Content | CTA |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| All visitors (7 days) | "Health insurance costs are crushing businesses in Augusta." + key stat | Visit website |
| Engaged visitors (30 days) | FAQ video clip: "What makes Vxtra different?" | Watch full video |
| High-intent visitors (60 days) | "See what your company could save." | Free cost analysis |
| Lead magnet downloaders (90 days) | "Ready to take the next step?" | Schedule a call |

#### Platform Priority
1. **LinkedIn** -- Primary. Decision-makers (CFOs, CEOs, HR directors) are on LinkedIn. Target by job title + geography + company size.
2. **Meta (Facebook/Instagram)** -- Secondary. Broader reach in local market. Good for community awareness.
3. **Google Display** -- Tertiary. Retarget website visitors across the web.

### 7. Qualification Criteria

Not every employer is a fit. Clear qualification criteria prevent wasted effort and protect the risk pool.

#### Must-Have Requirements

| Criterion | Requirement | Why |
|-----------|------------|-----|
| **Employees on plan** | 100+ lives minimum | Below 100, the economics don't work for the employer or the pool |
| **Self-insured status** | Currently self-insured for 2+ years | Employers already understand self-funding; shorter conversion cycle |
| **Geography** | Augusta MSA or Gainesville MSA (initially) | Our Town model requires local employer concentration |
| **Census data willingness** | Must provide anonymized census data | Required for plan design and cost analysis (no personal details needed) |

#### Ideal Profile

| Factor | Ideal |
|--------|-------|
| **Company size** | 200-2,000 employees |
| **Industry** | Manufacturing, healthcare services, education, government/quasi-government, logistics -- industries with large local workforces |
| **Current pain** | Renewal shock, rising costs, employee dissatisfaction, broker presenting same options every year |
| **Decision maker** | CFO, CEO, or HR VP with authority to change health plan vendor |
| **Renewal timing** | January 1 or July 1 renewal cycle (aligns with Vxtra launch windows) |
| **Broker relationship** | Works with Kelly/Salem (Augusta) or Bart/Sam (Gainesville) -- or willing to add Vxtra-aligned broker |

#### Qualification Tool (Website)

An interactive qualification widget on the website that asks 4 questions:

1. "How many employees are on your health plan?" (slider: 50 / 100 / 250 / 500 / 1,000 / 2,000+)
2. "Is your company self-insured?" (Yes / No / Not sure)
3. "Where is your company located?" (Augusta area / Gainesville area / Other Georgia / Outside Georgia)
4. "When does your health plan renew?" (January / July / Other / Not sure)

**Qualified path:** 100+ employees + self-insured + Augusta or Gainesville = "You qualify. Schedule your free cost analysis."
**Not yet qualified:** Outside market or too small = "We're not in your market yet, but we're growing. Join our waitlist."
**Unsure:** = "Not sure if you qualify? Let's have a quick conversation." + email capture

#### The 5,000 Lives Threshold

5,000 aggregated covered lives is the critical mass that unlocks:
- Better stop-loss pricing from Tokyo Marine HCC / Jay Richie
- Credible negotiating position with physicians
- Sustainable risk pool economics
- Foundation for the $3.5M private placement (Q3 2026)
- Proof of concept for expanding to the remaining 22 identified markets

This threshold should be tracked as the single most important leading indicator across all marketing activity. Every KPI above feeds into this number.

### Strategy Summary

The employer marketing strategy for Vxtra Health is fundamentally a **broker-facilitated, community-driven, education-first** approach. It is not a traditional digital marketing play. The strategy works because:

1. **Brokers are the channel.** Kelly/Salem in Augusta and Bart/Sam in Gainesville are the trusted advisors who open doors. Marketing supports them -- it does not replace them.

2. **The community IS the market.** In Augusta and Gainesville, "the dots are closer together." Civic groups, peer-to-peer conversations, and golf course introductions matter more than ad spend.

3. **Education builds trust.** Per Larry's principle: "educate without offending." The FAQ videos, blog content, and civic presentations all follow the Marcus Sheridan model -- answer real questions honestly.

4. **Larry is the brand.** His personal credibility (40+ years, multiple exits, physician practice growth) is the foundation of all authority. His LinkedIn presence, speaking engagements, and one-on-one conversations are the highest-leverage marketing activities.

5. **Capital Rx is the proof.** Riding the "wake" of Capital Rx's Fortune 100 announcements (Apple, GM) validates the technology story without Vxtra having to prove it independently.

6. **Urgency is organic.** The July 2026 launch window, the collective pool forming, and the "dancing guy" momentum create natural urgency -- no artificial scarcity needed.

The goal is not leads. The goal is **10 letters of intent in Augusta by June 30, 2026, representing 5,000+ covered lives.** Everything in this strategy is built to achieve that single outcome.
