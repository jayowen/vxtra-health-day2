<hr />
<h2 id="important-context">Important Context</h2>
<p>Employees do NOT choose Vxtra Health. Their employer does. These deliverables are designed for <strong>activation and adoption</strong> — not sales. By the time an employee sees this content, the deal is done. The goal is to make them feel safe, welcomed, and eager to use their benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Tone:</strong> Warm, simple, reassuring. Zero jargon. Low cognitive load. This person might be anxious about healthcare — make them feel like everything is going to be okay.</p>
<p><strong>Messaging rules:</strong> Never use “provider” (always “physician” or “doctor”). Never say “healthcare is broken.” No insurance jargon (EOB, TPA, PBM, CPT, stop-loss). Use dollar amounts, not percentages.</p>

<h3 id="a2.-welcome-problem-acknowledgment">A2. Welcome / Problem Acknowledgment</h3>
<p><strong>Section Label:</strong> We Get It</p>
<p><strong>Headline:</strong> Healthcare has been confusing and expensive for way too long.</p>
<p><strong>Body Copy:</strong></p>
<p>Going to the doctor used to mean worrying about what it would cost. Sitting on hold with your insurance company. Getting a surprise bill six weeks later. Nobody should have to live like that.</p>
<p>Your employer partnered with Vxtra Health to change that — for you and your family.</p>
<p>With Vxtra, you get a personal physician, a dedicated care team, and benefits that actually work the way they should. No hoops. No runaround. Just care.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="a3.-how-it-works-for-you">A3. How It Works (For You)</h3>
<p><strong>Section Label:</strong> How It Works</p>
<p><strong>Headline:</strong> Three simple steps. That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Get Connected to Your Physician</strong> We match you with a local doctor who gets to know you — not just your chart. This is your physician. They know your name, your history, and what matters to you.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Use Your Benefits Without Barriers</strong> No pre-authorizations. No surprise bills. No fighting with insurance. When you need care, you get care. It is that simple.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Get the Care You Need</strong> Whether it is a routine check-up, a specialist visit, or something unexpected — your care team handles the details so you can focus on feeling better.</p>
<p><strong>Closing line:</strong> That is the entire process. No fine print. No catch.</p>

<p><strong>Section Label:</strong> Vxtra Care</p>
<p><strong>Headline:</strong> After your appointment, we take it from here.</p>
<p><strong>Body Copy:</strong></p>
<p>Here is what usually happens after a doctor’s visit: You leave with a list of things to do — schedule an X-ray, find a specialist, get blood work, fill a prescription. Then you are on your own to figure it all out.</p>
<p>Not anymore.</p>
<p>After your appointment, call Vxtra Care. Your personal nurse navigator handles everything:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scheduling follow-ups</strong> — so you do not have to call around</li>
<li><strong>Coordinating specialists</strong> — finding the right doctor and getting you in</li>
<li><strong>Managing referrals</strong> — no paperwork, no delays</li>
<li><strong>Answering your questions</strong> — about your care, your benefits, anything</li>
</ul>
<p>You focus on getting better. We handle the rest.</p>

<h3 id="a6.-your-doctor">A6. Your Doctor</h3>
<p><strong>Section Label:</strong> Meet Your Physician</p>
<p><strong>Headline:</strong> A real doctor. In your community. Who actually knows you.</p>
<p><strong>Body Copy:</strong></p>
<p>Your Vxtra physician is not a voice on a telemedicine screen or a name on a rotating schedule. They are a local, independent doctor who chose to be part of the Vxtra network because they believe in this kind of care.</p>
<p>They practice in your community. They see you in person. They remember what you talked about last time. When you call their office, people know your name.</p>
<p>This is what healthcare used to feel like — and what it should feel like again.</p>
<p><strong>How you connect with your doctor:</strong> 1. We will introduce you to your assigned physician when you activate your benefits 2. You will schedule your first visit (or Vxtra Care will do it for you) 3. From there, they are your doctor — call them when you need them</p>
<p><strong>CTA:</strong> Meet Your Care Team</p>

<h3 id="a7.-frequently-asked-questions">A7. Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p><strong>Section Label:</strong> Questions? We Have Answers.</p>
<p><strong>Headline:</strong> Everything you want to know. Nothing confusing.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q: What does “$0 copay” really mean?</strong></p>
<p>It means exactly what it sounds like. When you visit your Vxtra physician, you pay nothing. Zero dollars. No bill at checkout, no bill in the mail. Your employer covers it through the Vxtra Health plan.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q: What if I need to see a specialist?</strong></p>
<p>Call Vxtra Care. Your nurse navigator will find the right specialist, schedule the appointment, and coordinate everything with your physician. You do not have to figure it out yourself.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q: What about emergencies?</strong></p>
<p>If you have a medical emergency, go to the emergency room. Vxtra Health covers emergency care. After you are stabilized, call Vxtra Care and your nurse navigator will coordinate any follow-up care you need.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q: How do I contact Vxtra Care?</strong></p>
<p>Call [Vxtra Care phone number] during business hours. A real person will answer — not an automated system. For non-urgent questions, you can also reach out through [portal/app details]. Response is the same day.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q: Can I keep my current doctor?</strong></p>
<p>If your current doctor is part of the Vxtra network, absolutely. If they are not currently in the network, let us know — we may be able to work with your physician to join. Either way, we will make sure you have a great doctor who is a good fit for you.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q: Does this cover my family too?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Your Vxtra benefits extend to your covered dependents — your spouse and your children. They get the same $0 copays, $0 deductibles, and access to Vxtra Care. Same benefits, same care, same peace of mind.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="a8.-final-cta">A8. Final CTA</h3>
<p><strong>Headline:</strong> You deserve healthcare that works for you.</p>
<p><strong>Body Copy:</strong> Your employer chose Vxtra Health because they want you to get the care you need — without the stress, the confusion, or the cost. All you have to do is take the first step.</p>
<p><strong>CTA Button (Primary):</strong> Meet Your Care Team <strong>CTA Button (Secondary):</strong> Call Vxtra Care</p>
<p><strong>Closing Reassurance Line:</strong> No insurance jargon. No surprise bills. Just better care.</p>
<h2 id="section-b-employee-page-wireframe">SECTION B: Employee Page Wireframe</h2>
<p><em>Top-to-bottom wireframe for the employee onboarding/welcome page. Mobile-first. Warm, inviting, low cognitive load.</em></p>
<hr />
<h3 id="design-philosophy">Design Philosophy</h3>
<p>This is a <strong>welcome page</strong>, not a sales page. The visitor already has Vxtra benefits — they just need to understand them and feel good about using them. Every design decision should reduce anxiety and increase trust.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mobile-first:</strong> Most employees will access this from a link in a text or email on their phone</li>
<li><strong>Low cognitive load:</strong> Short sections, large type, ample white space</li>
<li><strong>Photography:</strong> Warm, diverse, real people. Avoid clinical/hospital stock photography. Show people smiling, in their community, at ease. Think: families at dinner, a person laughing with their doctor, a nurse on the phone helping someone</li>
<li><strong>Color palette:</strong> Use the established Vxtra brand — teal (#22BAB4) for trust/health, coral (#E8734A) for CTAs/warmth, dark ink (#1B2A3D) for text, warm white backgrounds</li>
<li><strong>Typography:</strong> DM Serif Display for headlines (warm, approachable serif). Inter for body (clean, highly readable)</li>
<li><strong>Illustrations:</strong> Minimal. Prefer real photography. If icons are needed, use simple line icons consistent with the main site</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>DO NOT use:</strong> - Clinical/sterile hospital imagery - Stock photos with obvious artificial posing - Stethoscope-around-the-neck cliches - Sad/worried faces (this is a welcome page — energy should be positive) - Complex medical equipment or operating rooms - Generic corporate handshake photos</p>

<p><strong>Critical Transition: Awareness to Activation</strong></p>
<p>This is where most benefit programs lose people. The gap between “I heard about this” and “I actually signed up” is where confusion, inertia, and skepticism live. Close this gap with: - <strong>Immediate follow-up</strong> — welcome kit arrives within 48 hours of announcement - <strong>Personal outreach</strong> — Vxtra Care proactively calls each employee to introduce themselves - <strong>Simplicity</strong> — activation requires 5 minutes or less (name, DOB, preferred contact — done) - <strong>Employer reinforcement</strong> — HR sends 2-3 follow-up communications in the first 2 weeks</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="c2.-welcome-email-campaign">C2. Welcome Email Campaign</h3>

<h3 id="c3.-activation-tactics">C3. Activation Tactics</h3>
<p>Multiple touchpoints to drive activation, because different people respond to different channels. The goal is unavoidable awareness with zero annoyance.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Welcome Packet (Physical + Digital)</strong></p>
<p><em>Physical:</em> - Delivered to the employee’s home address (not just workplace) within 1 week of benefit activation - Contents: Welcome letter from Vxtra, benefits summary card (wallet-sized), Vxtra Care phone number magnet (refrigerator-worthy), physician information sheet, quick-start guide (1 page, large print) - Design: Clean, warm, branded. Feels premium — not junk mail. Consider a soft-touch envelope or branded folder. - Include a handwritten-style note: “Welcome to Vxtra Health. We are glad you are here.”</p>
<p><em>Digital:</em> - PDF versions of all physical materials available on employee portal - Mobile-optimized benefits card (can be saved to phone wallet) - Digital welcome video (60-90 seconds, featuring Vxtra Care team introducing themselves)</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Benefits Fair Presence</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Attend employer-hosted open enrollment events and benefits fairs</li>
<li>Staff with Vxtra Care team members (the same people employees will call)</li>
<li>Hands-on demo: walk employees through a mock Vxtra Care call</li>
<li>Provide printed materials + QR code to the employee landing page</li>
<li>Answer questions in real-time — remove anxiety on the spot</li>
<li>Have a “schedule your first appointment” station where Vxtra Care books visits live</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>On-Site Enrollment Sessions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Schedule 2-3 sessions at the employer’s workplace during the first 2 weeks</li>
<li>30-minute format: 15-minute presentation + 15-minute Q&amp;A</li>
<li>Led by Vxtra Care nurse navigators (builds familiarity before first call)</li>
<li>Cover: what changed, what you get, how to use Vxtra Care, how to see your doctor</li>
<li>Record sessions and make available for employees who could not attend</li>
<li>Provide snacks and a relaxed atmosphere — this should not feel like a corporate mandate</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Employer Champion Program</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Identify 3-5 employees per company who are enthusiastic about the benefit change</li>
<li>These “Vxtra Champions” act as peer advocates within the workplace</li>
<li>Provide them with:
<ul>
<li>Early access to benefits (if possible) so they have a firsthand story to tell</li>
<li>Talking points (not a script — conversational bullet points)</li>
<li>Branded swag (Vxtra t-shirt, water bottle — things that start conversations)</li>
<li>Direct line to Vxtra Care for any questions their peers bring to them</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Champions are not salespeople. They are trusted colleagues who can say: “I already used it and here is what happened.”</li>
<li>Incentive: Recognition, small gift cards, or wellness credits</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="c4.-vxtra-care-adoption-strategy">C4. Vxtra Care Adoption Strategy</h3>
<p>Vxtra Care is the single most differentiated feature for employees. If they use it once, they will use it again. The challenge is getting that first interaction.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Awareness Campaigns</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>“After Your Appointment” Campaign:</strong> Every employee interaction should end with a reminder to call Vxtra Care. Physician offices display Vxtra Care signage. After-visit text/email: “Need help with follow-ups? Call Vxtra Care at [number].”</li>
<li><strong>Scenario-Based Messaging:</strong> Short, relatable examples pushed via email and workplace posters:
<ul>
<li>“Need a specialist? Call Vxtra Care.”</li>
<li>“Confused about a prescription? Call Vxtra Care.”</li>
<li>“Doctor told you to get blood work? Call Vxtra Care — they will schedule it.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Workplace Signage:</strong> Posters in break rooms, bathrooms, near HR — simple design with Vxtra Care number and one sentence: “One call. We handle the rest.”</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>First-Use Program</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After an employee’s first appointment, Vxtra Care proactively calls them (not the other way around) to:
<ul>
<li>Ask how the visit went</li>
<li>Offer to handle any follow-ups</li>
<li>Make sure they know how to reach Vxtra Care in the future</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This proactive outreach is critical — it demonstrates the value before the employee has to seek it out</li>
<li>Track first-use conversion: What % of employees who see their doctor then engage Vxtra Care within 7 days?</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Satisfaction Surveys</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Brief (3-5 question) survey after first Vxtra Care interaction:
<ul>
<li>“How easy was it to reach us?”</li>
<li>“Did we resolve what you needed?”</li>
<li>“Would you call Vxtra Care again?”</li>
<li>“What could we do better?”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Use responses to refine the service and generate testimonials (with permission)</li>
<li>Share aggregate satisfaction scores with employers as proof of value</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="c5.-ongoing-engagement">C5. Ongoing Engagement</h3>
<p>After activation, maintain a steady presence in the employee’s life — not overwhelming, but consistent enough that Vxtra stays top-of-mind when they need care.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Wellness Content (Monthly)</strong> - Monthly email or portal content focused on practical health topics - Seasonal relevance: flu season prep, summer safety, back-to-school physicals, mental health awareness - Format: Short (under 300 words), actionable, ties back to “talk to your doctor” or “call Vxtra Care” - NOT generic newsletter content — personalized to the local community when possible (e.g., “Allergy season in Augusta starts early this year”)</p>
<hr />

<h3 id="c8.-retention-focus">C8. Retention Focus</h3>
<p><strong>The benchmark:</strong> Traditional insurance companies retain members for 36-42 months on average. Vxtra’s goal is to significantly exceed this through relationship-based care and the Vxtra Care concierge — building loyalty that commodity insurance cannot match.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Why Vxtra Should Retain Longer</strong></p>
<p>Traditional insurance is transactional. Employees have no relationship with their insurer. When the employer switches plans, employees feel nothing — because there was nothing to feel.</p>
<p>Vxtra is relational. The employee has: - A physician who knows them by name - A nurse navigator who has helped them schedule appointments and coordinate care - A history of $0 bills and no runaround - Trust built through repeated positive experiences</p>
<p>Switching away from Vxtra means losing those relationships. That is a powerful retention mechanism — not because of lock-in, but because of genuine value.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Retention Strategy: Employee Side</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Deepen the physician relationship</strong> — Encourage annual wellness visits, proactive check-ins, and continuity of care. The longer the doctor-patient relationship, the harder it is to walk away.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Vxtra Care as the stickiness layer</strong> — Every interaction with Vxtra Care builds switching cost. Not financial switching cost — emotional switching cost. “Who is going to schedule my specialist visits if I lose Vxtra Care?”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Celebrate milestones</strong> — One-year anniversary email: “You have been with Vxtra for a year. Here is what we did together: 4 doctor visits, 2 specialist referrals coordinated by Vxtra Care, $0 out of pocket.” Make the value tangible and personal.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Collect and share stories</strong> — Employee testimonials (with permission) create social proof. “I never used to go to the doctor. Now I actually look forward to my check-ups.” These stories reinforce the community feeling and become tools for employer retention conversations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Anticipate renewal season</strong> — 90 days before the employer’s renewal decision, proactively reach out to employees with a satisfaction survey. Share aggregate results with the employer. Let employee sentiment be the most powerful renewal argument.</p></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p><strong>Retention Strategy: Employer Side (Employee-Driven)</strong></p>
<p>The strongest argument for employer renewal is employee satisfaction. Structure reporting to make this undeniable:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>“What your employees are saying”</strong> — Include anonymized employee quotes in every quarterly review</li>
<li><strong>Utilization proof</strong> — “87% of your employees have seen their physician. 62% have used Vxtra Care. Your previous plan had 41% utilization.”</li>
<li><strong>Cost avoidance narrative</strong> — “8% of people spend 80% of healthcare dollars. Vxtra Care helped [X] employees get preventive care that caught issues early — before they became expensive emergencies.”</li>
<li><strong>Retention correlation</strong> — Track whether employees with higher Vxtra engagement have lower turnover. Even anecdotal evidence is compelling.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>The Long Game</strong></p>
<p>Vxtra’s retention advantage is not a gimmick or a contract clause. It is the natural result of a system that actually works for people. When someone has a doctor who knows them, a care team that handles the hard parts, and $0 bills — they do not want to go back to the old way.</p>
<p>The employee becomes Vxtra’s most powerful advocate at renewal time. Not because anyone asked them to. Because they mean it.</p>
