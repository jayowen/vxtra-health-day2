## Section B: Technical Scope

Requirements for Vxtra Health's digital infrastructure, from website through CRM through custom tools.

---

### 1. Website

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Description** | Full website refresh with StoryBrand-structured copy, four persona landing pages, interactive tools, blog/resource hub. Mobile-first responsive design. |
| **Platform Recommendation** | **Static HTML + lightweight CMS for blog** (e.g., Hugo, Eleventy, or Astro with a headless CMS like Contentful or simple markdown-based approach). Vxtra does not need a full WordPress installation. Static sites are faster, more secure, and cheaper to host. If the team prefers a traditional CMS for ease of editing, a managed WordPress installation with a premium theme is the fallback. |
| **Hosting** | Netlify or Vercel (for static) or managed WordPress host (WP Engine, Flywheel). SSL included. CDN for performance. |
| **SSL** | Required. Included with modern hosting. HTTPS everywhere. |
| **Analytics** | Google Analytics 4, HubSpot tracking code, Google Tag Manager for centralized tag management. |
| **SEO** | XML sitemap, robots.txt, structured data markup (Organization, LocalBusiness), meta titles/descriptions per page, Open Graph tags, fast page load (<3s), clean URL structure. |
| **Responsive Design** | Mobile-first. Breakpoints for mobile, tablet, desktop. All interactive tools must work on mobile. |
| **ADA Compliance** | WCAG 2.1 Level AA. Alt text on all images, keyboard navigation, sufficient color contrast, screen reader compatibility, form labels. Healthcare audience makes this non-negotiable. |
| **Two-Track Routing** | Augusta/Gainesville visitors see local broker CTAs and market-specific content. Outside-market visitors see general consultation flow. Implementation: geo-IP detection or simple "Select Your Market" modal. |
| **Priority** | Must Have |
| **Complexity** | Medium |
| **Dependencies** | Finalized brand copy (done), design direction (confirmed: minimalist, corporate, Apple-style), headshots (Larry's needed), HubSpot form integrations |

---

| **Reporting Dashboards** | Pipeline dashboard (deals by stage, velocity, conversion rates), marketing dashboard (traffic, leads, lead magnet downloads, email performance), Augusta market dashboard (employers contacted, qualified, LOI signed, employees enrolled). Target: 500 employees by October 2026. |
| **Form Integrations** | Website forms (contact, qualification tool, lead magnet gates, scheduling) push directly to HubSpot contacts with proper field mapping and pipeline placement. |

### Fractional CMO Recommendation

**We recommend a fractional CMO / marketing partnership model over a full-time marketing hire for the first 12-18 months.** Here is why:

1. **Cost efficiency.** A full-time VP of Marketing or CMO costs $150K-$250K+ in salary and benefits. A fractional engagement delivers senior strategic leadership at a fraction of that cost — critical when working capital is $2M and every dollar needs to drive toward 500 enrolled employees.

2. **Immediate capability.** There is no 3-month ramp-up period. Business Builders already has full context from the StoryBrand workshop, understands the messaging, knows the personas, and has the production team ready to execute. Day one is productive.

3. **Full team, not one person.** A fractional model through Business Builders provides a strategist, designer, developer, copywriter, and video coordinator — not a single marketing generalist trying to do everything alone.

4. **Flexibility.** As Vxtra grows and funding scales (private placement $3.5M in Q3, additional markets in 2027), the engagement can scale up or transition to an in-house hire supported by the agency. The fractional model bridges the gap.

5. **Sandra's bandwidth.** Larry acknowledged that Sandra is running full-time operations and no one on the Vxtra team is dedicated to marketing. A fractional partner handles execution so the Vxtra team can focus on what they do best — building the health plan and serving employers.

The right time to evaluate a full-time marketing hire is after Augusta has proven the model (Q1 2027) and Gainesville launch planning demands dedicated in-house coordination.
