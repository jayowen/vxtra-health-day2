<h3 id="email-nurture-sequence">3. Email Nurture Sequence</h3>
<p>Triggered after any lead magnet capture. 7-email sequence over 21 days. All emails come from Larry Hightower (personal, not brand@).</p>
<h4 id="email-1-welcome-the-problem-day-0">Email 1: Welcome + The Problem (Day 0)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subject Line:</strong> “The math on health insurance isn’t getting friendlier”</li>
<li><strong>Key Message:</strong> Thank them for downloading/registering. Restate the core problem: costs are rising 7-10% annually, doubling in a decade. Acknowledge the frustration – “We know renewal season feels like a gut punch.” Brief intro to Vxtra and the Our Town model.</li>
<li><strong>CTA:</strong> “Reply to this email with your biggest health insurance frustration”</li>
<li><strong>Tone:</strong> Empathetic, personal, conversational</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="email-2-the-villain-day-3">Email 2: The Villain (Day 3)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subject Line:</strong> “Where your health insurance premiums actually go”</li>
<li><strong>Key Message:</strong> The 1,600% insurance stock appreciation stat. The fact that insurance companies are administrators for self-funded plans, not risk-bearers – yet they still extract massive fees. Hospital administrators grew 2,500% vs. 100% physician growth. Frame the systemic misalignment without naming specific insurers (Cigna constraint).</li>
<li><strong>CTA:</strong> Link to FAQ video: “Why do health insurance costs keep going up?”</li>
<li><strong>Tone:</strong> Educational, factual, controlled frustration</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="email-3-the-technology-story-day-6">Email 3: The Technology Story (Day 6)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subject Line:</strong> “Your company deserves Fortune 100 benefits”</li>
<li><strong>Key Message:</strong> Introduce Capital Rx and the Judi platform. Transparent data in 30 days or less (vs. 120-day industry standard). First platform to process medical and Rx claims together. NADAC drug pricing. “Until now, this technology was only available to the largest companies in the world. Vxtra Health brings it to employers with 200 to 2,000 employees.”</li>
<li><strong>CTA:</strong> Link to cost calculator tool</li>
<li><strong>Tone:</strong> Optimistic, forward-looking, credibility-building</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="email-4-the-our-town-model-day-9">Email 4: The Our Town Model (Day 9)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subject Line:</strong> “In Augusta, the dots are closer together”</li>
<li><strong>Key Message:</strong> Explain how the Our Town model works in plain language. Local independent physicians (same treatment, 40-70% less than hospital systems). Collective purchasing power when employers pool together. “People like us do things like this” community messaging. Name Augusta specifically.</li>
<li><strong>CTA:</strong> “See how employers in Augusta are coming together” (link to Our Town section of website)</li>
<li><strong>Tone:</strong> Community-driven, warm, local pride</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="email-5-the-employee-experience-day-13">Email 5: The Employee Experience (Day 13)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subject Line:</strong> “What if your employees actually loved their health plan?”</li>
<li><strong>Key Message:</strong> Introduce Vxtra Care (care orchestration/concierge). $0 copays, $0 deductibles, no pre-authorization. Personal nurse navigation – employee leaves the doctor, calls Vxtra Care, and everything gets scheduled. “68% of employees say benefits are a top factor in staying. This is how you keep your best people.”</li>
<li><strong>CTA:</strong> “Schedule a conversation about what this looks like for your team”</li>
<li><strong>Tone:</strong> Aspirational, employee-centric, vision-casting</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="email-6-social-proof-urgency-day-17">Email 6: Social Proof + Urgency (Day 17)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subject Line:</strong> “Augusta employers are already asking about this”</li>
<li><strong>Key Message:</strong> Without naming specific employers, communicate momentum: “We’re having conversations with employers across Augusta right now. The July 2026 launch window is approaching, and the collective pool is forming.” Reference the 5,000 covered lives threshold. “The earlier your company joins, the stronger the pool becomes for everyone.”</li>
<li><strong>CTA:</strong> “Request your free cost analysis”</li>
<li><strong>Tone:</strong> Momentum, community, urgency without pressure</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="email-7-direct-ask-day-21">Email 7: Direct Ask (Day 21)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subject Line:</strong> “One conversation. No commitment.”</li>
<li><strong>Key Message:</strong> The direct ask. “I’d like to schedule a 30-minute conversation with you and your broker. No pitch, no pressure – just an honest look at whether Vxtra is the right fit for your company.” Restate the transformation: “From feeling trapped every renewal cycle to having a plan your employees love and costs you can actually control.”</li>
<li><strong>CTA:</strong> “Schedule a Call” (link to Calendly/scheduling tool)</li>
<li><strong>Tone:</strong> Direct, confident, low-pressure</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="sequence-notes">Sequence Notes:</h4>
<ul>
<li>If recipient clicks “Schedule a Call” at any point, remove from nurture and move to qualified pipeline</li>
<li>If recipient downloads the cost analysis lead magnet, skip to Email 5 (they’ve already engaged with the problem/solution)</li>
<li>After Email 7, move to monthly newsletter list (not dead – just not ready yet)</li>
<li>All emails should be plain-text style (no heavy HTML templates) – feels like a real email from Larry</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="broker-facilitated-conversion-strategy">4. Broker-Facilitated Conversion Strategy</h3>
<p>Brokers are the gateway to employers. Vxtra never goes direct. The broker relationship is protected and compensated (3-year contracts, 40% upfront commissions).</p>
<h4 id="augusta-market-kelly-and-salem">Augusta Market: Kelly and Salem</h4>
<p>Kelly and Salem have completed 1.5 years of groundwork in Augusta. They are at 8/10 readiness. Their approach is unique and critical to the go-to-market strategy:</p>
<p><strong>Multi-Employer Table Strategy</strong> Kelly’s approach is to bring multiple employers to the table at once – not one-by-one selling. This is foundational to the Our Town model because: - Employers see peer validation immediately (“I’m not the only one considering this”) - Collective volume triggers better stop-loss pricing from Jay Richie / Tokyo Marine HCC - Accelerates the path to 5,000 covered lives threshold - Reduces individual employer risk perception (“If Company X is in, this must be real”)</p>
<p><strong>The “Dancing Guy” Approach</strong> The first employer to sign is the leader. The second employer validates. Then momentum builds naturally. Kelly and Salem facilitate this through: - Golf course introductions between business owners - Owner-to-owner peer conversations (“Let me tell you what I’m looking at for our health plan”) - Informal selling that’s already happening: “I already told three people about this” - Civic group overlap (Rotary, Chamber members who are also employer decision-makers)</p>
<p><strong>Broker Enablement Materials (What Kelly and Salem Need)</strong> 1. Single-page sales sheet – outcome-focused, not operational detail (“don’t tell them how to build the watch”) 2. Qualification checklist – 100+ employees on plan, self-insured 2+ years, census data process 3. Objection response guide – top 10 employer objections with StoryBrand-aligned responses 4. Employer introduction email template – broker sends to client with Vxtra overview 5. Discovery call scheduling link – broker books the three-way with Vxtra directly</p>
<h4 id="gainesville-market-bart-and-sam">Gainesville Market: Bart and Sam</h4>
<p>Bart and Sam are the broker pair for Gainesville (July 2027 launch). Sam is a former 2-term mayor of Gainesville, which provides significant advantages:</p>
<p><strong>Sam’s Community Influence</strong> - Known by virtually every business owner and civic leader in Gainesville - Former mayoral role gives inherent credibility and trust - Can open doors that cold outreach never could - Natural convener – can host employer dinners, roundtables, informal gatherings - His endorsement carries weight equivalent to institutional backing in a secondary market</p>
<p><strong>Gainesville Strategy (Starting H2 2026)</strong> 1. Sam and Bart begin informal conversations with top employer targets Q3-Q4 2026 2. Use Augusta as the proof case: “Here’s what’s happening in Augusta right now” 3. Host an employer roundtable dinner in Gainesville (Q1 2027) – Sam convenes, Larry presents 4. Target letters of intent by spring 2027 for July 1, 2027 launch 5. Leverage Augusta operating metrics and employer testimonials as proof</p>
<h4 id="broker-conversion-process-both-markets">Broker Conversion Process (Both Markets)</h4>
<pre><code>Step 1: Broker identifies qualified employer from existing book of business
        (self-insured, 100+ on plan, 2+ years self-funded)

Step 2: Broker introduces Vxtra concept in next client meeting or
        renewal conversation (&quot;I have something new to show you&quot;)

Step 3: Broker sends employer introduction email with Vxtra overview
        and link to website / lead magnet

Step 4: Broker schedules three-way discovery call
        (broker + employer + Larry/Sandra)

Step 5: Employer submits census data for free cost analysis

Step 6: Vxtra delivers custom plan design and ROI projection

Step 7: Broker facilitates peer-to-peer conversations with
        other employers in the market (&quot;dancing guy&quot; momentum)

Step 8: Employer signs letter of intent

Step 9: Onboarding begins (60-90 days before go-live)</code></pre>

<h4 id="the-5000-lives-threshold">The 5,000 Lives Threshold</h4>
<p>5,000 aggregated covered lives is the critical mass that unlocks: - Better stop-loss pricing from Tokyo Marine HCC / Jay Richie - Credible negotiating position with physicians - Sustainable risk pool economics - Foundation for the $3.5M private placement (Q3 2026) - Proof of concept for expanding to the remaining 22 identified markets</p>
<p>This threshold should be tracked as the single most important leading indicator across all marketing activity. Every KPI above feeds into this number.</p>

<p>The employer marketing strategy for Vxtra Health is fundamentally a <strong>broker-facilitated, community-driven, education-first</strong> approach. It is not a traditional digital marketing play. The strategy works because:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Brokers are the channel.</strong> Kelly/Salem in Augusta and Bart/Sam in Gainesville are the trusted advisors who open doors. Marketing supports them – it does not replace them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The community IS the market.</strong> In Augusta and Gainesville, “the dots are closer together.” Civic groups, peer-to-peer conversations, and golf course introductions matter more than ad spend.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Education builds trust.</strong> Per Larry’s principle: “educate without offending.” The FAQ videos, blog content, and civic presentations all follow the Marcus Sheridan model – answer real questions honestly.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Larry is the brand.</strong> His personal credibility (40+ years, multiple exits, physician practice growth) is the foundation of all authority. His LinkedIn presence, speaking engagements, and one-on-one conversations are the highest-leverage marketing activities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Capital Rx is the proof.</strong> Riding the “wake” of Capital Rx’s Fortune 100 announcements (Apple, GM) validates the technology story without Vxtra having to prove it independently.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Urgency is organic.</strong> The July 2026 launch window, the collective pool forming, and the “dancing guy” momentum create natural urgency – no artificial scarcity needed.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The goal is not leads. The goal is <strong>10 letters of intent in Augusta by June 30, 2026, representing 5,000+ covered lives.</strong> Everything in this strategy is built to achieve that single outcome.</p>
