<h3 id="a2.-problem-section-peace-staircase">A2. Problem Section (PEACE Staircase)</h3>
<p><strong>Section Label:</strong> THE REAL PROBLEM</p>
<p><strong>Lead-In:</strong> Insurance companies are practicing medicine for you.</p>
<p><strong>Problem Statement 1 — Lost Authority:</strong> You diagnose the patient. You determine the treatment plan. Then an insurance company employee who has never examined your patient overrides your clinical judgment with a denial letter. Every day, physicians across the country lose hours to pre-authorization forms, peer-to-peer reviews, and appeals — time that should be spent with patients.</p>
<p><strong>Problem Statement 2 — The Bureaucracy Tax:</strong> The average physician now spends more time on paperwork than patient care. Pre-authorizations delay treatment. Denials force re-submissions. Step therapy protocols override clinical expertise. The system was designed to reduce insurance company costs — not to improve patient outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Problem Statement 3 — Vanishing Independence:</strong> Hospital systems are buying up independent practices at an unprecedented rate, promising relief from the administrative burden but delivering even less autonomy. Once you’re employed by a hospital, your patient volume targets, referral patterns, and even your treatment decisions are dictated by administrators — not by you. And the same treatment that costs 40-70% less in your independent practice now carries hospital-system pricing that your patients can barely afford.</p>
<p><strong>Empathy Close:</strong> You didn’t spend a decade in training to fight pre-authorization forms and get told how to treat your own patients by someone who has never seen them.</p>

<h3 id="a3.-value-stack">A3. Value Stack</h3>
<p><strong>Section Label:</strong> WHAT CHANGES WITH VXTRA HEALTH</p>
<p><strong>Headline:</strong> A network designed by physicians, for physicians.</p>
<p><strong>Subheadline:</strong> Vxtra Health removes the insurance company from the exam room and gives you back what you earned.</p>
<p><strong>Value 1 — No Pre-Authorizations</strong> <em>Headline:</em> Your clinical decisions are final. <em>Body:</em> When you determine a patient needs treatment, that treatment happens. No pre-authorization forms. No peer-to-peer reviews with someone reading from a script. No delays. You order it. It gets done.</p>
<p><strong>Value 2 — No Denials</strong> <em>Headline:</em> Your patients get the care you prescribe. <em>Body:</em> The insurance denial machine does not exist in the Vxtra network. When you make a clinical decision, it stands. Your expertise is the authority — not an algorithm built to minimize payouts.</p>
<p><strong>Value 3 — Direct Relationship with Local Employers</strong> <em>Headline:</em> You work with the community, not a faceless corporation. <em>Body:</em> Vxtra connects you directly with self-insured employers in your market. These are local companies whose employees live in your community. They want their people to see physicians they trust — and they want those physicians to have full clinical authority.</p>
<p><strong>Value 4 — Technology Handles the Administration</strong> <em>Headline:</em> Fortune 100 technology. Zero administrative burden on you. <em>Body:</em> Vxtra’s technology platform — powered by Capital Rx — processes claims, manages data, and handles the administrative work that currently consumes your day. You get transparent data on your patient panel without the paperwork. Claims process in 30 days or less, not 120.</p>
<p><strong>Value 5 — Independent Practice, Protected</strong> <em>Headline:</em> Stay independent. Stay in charge. <em>Body:</em> Vxtra was built to strengthen independent physician practices — not to acquire them. You maintain your practice, your staff, your patient relationships, and your clinical autonomy. Vxtra brings you patients, handles the business side, and stays out of your exam room.</p>

<h3 id="a4.-authority-section">A4. Authority Section</h3>
<p><strong>Section Label:</strong> WHO BUILT THIS</p>
<p><strong>Headline:</strong> Built by people who understand physician practice from the inside.</p>
<p><strong>Authority Block 1 — Larry Hightower, Co-Founder &amp; CEO</strong> Larry grew a urology practice from 30 to 100 physicians — approximately 1.5% of all urologists in the United States. He understands the economics of physician practice, the pressures of hospital consolidation, and what it takes to build a network that works for the doctors inside it. He spent 40+ years on the business side of healthcare, sold companies at 22x and 15x earnings, and built Vxtra specifically to put physicians back in charge.</p>
<p><em>Quote:</em> “Health insurance companies have hijacked healthcare and make it very difficult for doctors and nurses to do what they do best.”</p>
<p><strong>Authority Block 2 — Sandra &amp; Andrew, Health Plan Operations</strong> Sandra brings 30+ years of experience in health plan processing, claims, contracts, sales, and the technical components that make a health plan actually work. She has been on every side of the table — insurance company, employer, physician practice — and built Vxtra’s operations to serve physicians rather than obstruct them.</p>
<p><strong>Authority Block 3 — Technology Backing</strong> Vxtra is powered by Capital Rx, the technology platform trusted by Fortune 100 companies. Capital Rx’s Judi platform is the first system to process both prescription and medical claims together, providing transparent data in 30 days or less that was previously available only to the largest corporations in the country. Tokyo Marine HCC, one of the world’s leading reinsurance companies, has invested $1.5M in Vxtra — a level of institutional backing that signals long-term viability.</p>
<p><strong>Key Stat Callout:</strong> Physician-led. Not insurance-company-led. Not hospital-system-led.</p>

<h3 id="a5.-plan-section">A5. Plan Section</h3>
<p><strong>Section Label:</strong> HOW IT WORKS</p>
<p><strong>Headline:</strong> Three steps to practicing medicine on your terms.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 — Join the Vxtra Network</strong> Have a conversation with our team. We will walk you through the model, answer your questions, and make sure it is the right fit for your practice. No pressure, no commitments until you are ready.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2 — Work Directly with Local Employers</strong> Vxtra connects you with self-insured employers in your community. Their employees become part of your patient panel. You build real, lasting physician-patient relationships with people who live and work near you.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3 — Practice Medicine Your Way</strong> You make the clinical decisions. Technology handles the claims and data. No insurance company sits between you and your patient. You run an independent practice in a community that knows your name.</p>

<h3 id="a6.-stakes-section">A6. Stakes Section</h3>
<p><strong>Section Label:</strong> WHAT HAPPENS IF NOTHING CHANGES</p>
<p><strong>Headline:</strong> The status quo is not standing still. It is accelerating.</p>
<p><strong>Stake 1 — More Pre-Authorizations, Less Autonomy</strong> Insurance companies add new pre-authorization requirements every year. The administrative burden is growing, not shrinking. Every new requirement is another decision taken out of your hands.</p>
<p><strong>Stake 2 — Hospital Consolidation Is Accelerating</strong> Hospital systems are acquiring independent practices at record pace, offering buyouts that come with employment contracts — and employment contracts come with productivity quotas, referral mandates, and corporate oversight of your clinical decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Stake 3 — The Numbers Tell the Story</strong> 80% of hospital-employed physicians report wanting to return to independent practice. Physician pay has declined 33% since 2001 when adjusted for inflation. Hospital administrators grew 2,500% between 1999 and 2014, while physician growth was approximately 100%. The system is being built around administrators, not around you.</p>
<p><strong>Stake 4 — Your Patients Feel It Too</strong> When you lose clinical authority, your patients lose their trusted physician. They get routed through call centers, wait for pre-authorization approvals, and receive care dictated by cost models — not by the person who examined them.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="a7.-success-vision">A7. Success Vision</h3>
<p><strong>Section Label:</strong> IMAGINE THIS INSTEAD</p>
<p><strong>Headline:</strong> Practice medicine the way you always intended to.</p>
<p><strong>Vision 1 — Agency Restored</strong> You walk into the exam room and your clinical judgment is the final word. No pre-authorization queue. No denial letter waiting in your inbox. Your patient needs treatment — they get it. Today.</p>
<p><strong>Vision 2 — Community-Centered Care</strong> Your patients are your neighbors. They work at local companies. They see you at the grocery store, at their kids’ school events, at community gatherings. This is medicine the way it was meant to work — physicians and patients in the same community, building real relationships over years.</p>
<p><strong>Vision 3 — Independent Practice, Sustainable</strong> You run your own practice. You set your own standards. Your overhead is manageable because you are not carrying hospital-system cost structures. You are part of a network that supports your independence rather than threatening it.</p>
<p><strong>Vision 4 — Your Patients Trust YOU</strong> Not a call center. Not an insurance company website. Not a prior authorization department. Your patients call your office, they see you, and they trust that the care plan you designed is the care plan they will receive.</p>
<p><strong>Closing Line:</strong> Your patients trust you — not a call center. You make the clinical decisions. And you run an independent practice in a community that knows your name.</p>

<h3 id="a10.-faq-section">A10. FAQ Section</h3>
<p><strong>Section Label:</strong> QUESTIONS PHYSICIANS ASK</p>
<p><strong>Q1: How does payment work?</strong> A: Vxtra Health works with self-insured employers who fund their own health plans. You are paid directly for the care you deliver — on time, at agreed-upon rates, without the claim denials and delayed reimbursements that come from traditional insurance companies. Claims are processed through our technology platform in 30 days or less, compared to the 120-day cycle typical with legacy insurers.</p>
<p><strong>Q2: What is the time commitment to participate?</strong> A: Joining the Vxtra network does not require exclusive participation. You continue seeing your existing patients from all sources. Vxtra adds a new patient stream from local employers — employees who live and work in your community. The administrative burden is minimal because our technology handles claims, data, and coordination.</p>
<p><strong>Q3: Do I keep my other patients and insurance contracts?</strong> A: Yes. Vxtra is additive, not exclusive. You maintain your existing patient panel and all current contracts. Vxtra brings additional patients to your practice from local self-insured employers. Over time, many physicians find that the Vxtra patient panel grows naturally as employers in the community join the network.</p>
<p><strong>Q4: What technology do I need to set up?</strong> A: Our technology platform integrates with your existing practice management system. There is no major system overhaul required. The Capital Rx platform handles claims processing and data — you interact with a straightforward dashboard that shows your patient panel, claims status, and outcomes data in real time.</p>
<p><strong>Q5: Who makes the clinical decisions?</strong> A: You do. That is the foundational principle of the Vxtra network. There are no pre-authorizations. There are no insurance company denials of your treatment plans. You examine the patient, determine the treatment, and proceed. Vxtra’s care orchestration team supports coordination (scheduling, referrals, follow-up) — but clinical authority stays with you.</p>
<p><strong>Q6: Is this only for primary care physicians?</strong> A: Vxtra is building a comprehensive local physician network. We start with primary care because that is where the patient relationship begins, but we also need specialists. As the network grows in your market, Vxtra adds specialty coverage so that patients can receive coordinated care within the community. If you are a specialist, we want to hear from you.</p>

<hr />
<h3 id="c1.-physician-recruitment-funnel">C1. Physician Recruitment Funnel</h3>
<p>The physician recruitment funnel is relationship-driven by design. Physicians do not respond to cold outreach from health plan companies. They respond to peer recommendations and trusted relationships.</p>
<p><strong>Funnel Stages:</strong></p>
<pre><code>STAGE 1: IDENTIFICATION
Larry&#39;s personal physician network + market research
Identify independent physicians in target market
Focus: primary care first, then key specialties
Selection criteria applied (see C2 below)
     |
     v
STAGE 2: WARM INTRODUCTION
Larry or existing physician influencer makes personal introduction
Could be: phone call, lunch meeting, medical society event, mutual colleague
Never cold. Always relationship-first.
     |
     v
STAGE 3: 1-ON-1 CONVERSATION
Larry and/or Sandra meet with physician privately
Walk through the model: no pre-auths, no denials, employer-direct
Address physician-specific concerns (payment, time, exclusivity)
Share the vision: &quot;Our Town&quot; community model
     |
     v
STAGE 4: SITE VISIT / TECHNOLOGY DEMO
Show the Capital Rx platform and data capabilities
Demonstrate the claims process (30-day-or-less cycle)
Show how patient panel management works
Meet the operations team (Sandra/Andrew)
     |
     v
STAGE 5: JOIN THE NETWORK
Formal agreement to participate
Technology integration with practice management system
Patient panel assignment begins
Onboarding process initiated (see C5)
     |
     v
STAGE 6: ACTIVATE &amp; REFER
Physician sees first Vxtra patients
Positive experience leads to peer referrals
Physician becomes network advocate
Cycle repeats with new physician introductions</code></pre>
<p><strong>Key Principle:</strong> Larry grew a urology practice from 30 to 100 physicians. He knows how physicians make decisions — through trusted peer relationships, demonstrated results, and respect for their autonomy. The recruitment funnel mirrors exactly how he built that practice.</p>
<p><strong>Conversion Expectation:</strong> Aim for 60-70% conversion from Stage 3 (1-on-1 conversation) to Stage 5 (join network). Physicians who agree to a private conversation with Larry are already pre-qualified by the warm introduction.</p>
<hr />

</table>
<p><strong>Ideal Top 5 Composition per Market:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Primary Care Anchor (1-2 physicians):</strong> Family medicine or internal medicine group, well-established, large patient panel, community pillar. This is the foundation.</li>
<li><strong>Surgical/Procedural Specialist (1):</strong> Orthopedics, general surgery, or urology — high-volume specialty where hospital cost differential (40-70%) is most visible.</li>
<li><strong>Diagnostic/Imaging Specialist (1):</strong> Radiology, cardiology, or similar — controls referral flow and diagnostic capacity.</li>
<li><strong>Women’s Health / Pediatrics (1):</strong> OB/GYN or pediatrician — critical for employee families, high emotional engagement.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Augusta Market Approach:</strong> - Larry’s existing network in Georgia is the starting point - Augusta has a strong independent physician presence (40-45% of market) - Medical College of Georgia creates a pipeline of physicians who trained locally and stayed - Target physicians who are active in the Greater Augusta Medical Society - Identify physicians who have publicly spoken about insurance frustrations or practice autonomy</p>
<p><strong>Identification Process:</strong> 1. Larry maps his existing relationships in the market (personal network audit) 2. Cross-reference with independent practice directories and state licensing data 3. Consult with Augusta-based brokers (Kelly, Salem) who know which physicians employers already trust 4. Attend or monitor medical society events for leadership identification 5. Finalize Top 5 list and begin warm introduction sequence</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="c3.-outreach-approach">C3. Outreach Approach</h3>
<p><strong>Core Rule:</strong> Relationships first. Never cold outreach.</p>
<p><strong>Primary Channels:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Larry’s Personal Network</strong> Larry’s 40+ years in healthcare and his track record of growing a urology practice from 30 to 100 physicians means he knows physicians personally — or knows someone who does — in most secondary markets in the Southeast. This is the most powerful recruitment tool Vxtra has.</p>
<ul>
<li>Larry makes direct calls to physicians he knows</li>
<li>Larry asks trusted colleagues for introductions to physicians he does not know</li>
<li>Every new market begins with Larry mapping who he knows and who he needs to meet</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Medical Society Events</strong> Georgia Medical Society, Greater Augusta Medical Society, and specialty-specific societies are where physicians gather and where trust is built.</p>
<ul>
<li>Attend events as a peer, not as a vendor</li>
<li>Larry’s credibility (physician practice builder, not insurance executive) opens doors</li>
<li>Target events where independent physicians congregate — not hospital-affiliated functions</li>
<li>Sponsor or speak at events focused on practice management, autonomy, or healthcare economics</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Peer Referrals</strong> Once the first 2-3 physicians join the Vxtra network and have positive experiences, peer referral becomes the most powerful recruiting channel.</p>
<ul>
<li>Physicians trust other physicians over any marketing material</li>
<li>Facilitate “physician to physician” conversations — let existing network members tell their own story</li>
<li>Create informal networking opportunities (dinners, roundtables) where prospects meet current members</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Broker-Facilitated Introductions</strong> Brokers (Kelly, Salem in Augusta) have existing relationships with physicians through their employer clients. A broker can say: “Dr. Smith, the employers I work with are looking at a new approach — can I introduce you to the team behind it?”</p>
<ul>
<li>Leverages existing trust between broker and physician</li>
<li>Positions the introduction as employer-driven, not sales-driven</li>
<li>Particularly effective for physicians who already serve employees of the broker’s clients</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What We Do NOT Do:</strong> - No cold calls - No cold emails - No mass mailers - No pharmaceutical-style “detailing” visits - No advertising to physicians (at this stage) - We do not beg friends for business — Larry’s words. The model sells itself when presented to the right physician at the right time.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="c4.-content-strategy-physician-focused">C4. Content Strategy (Physician-Focused)</h3>
<p><strong>LinkedIn Thought Leadership (Larry’s Profile)</strong></p>
<p>Larry’s personal LinkedIn is the primary content channel for reaching physicians. His credibility as a practice builder (not a marketer or insurance executive) makes him the ideal voice.</p>
<p><em>Post themes (rotating weekly):</em> 1. <strong>Clinical autonomy</strong> — “What happened to the physician’s authority to practice medicine?” 2. <strong>Insurance bureaucracy statistics</strong> — Data-driven posts showing the administrative burden on physicians (2,500% admin growth vs. 100% physician growth) 3. <strong>Independent practice economics</strong> — Same treatment costs 40-70% less outside hospital systems 4. <strong>Hospital consolidation trends</strong> — 80% of hospital-employed physicians want independence back 5. <strong>Physician identity</strong> — “They are physicians, not providers” (the language of respect) 6. <strong>Community healthcare</strong> — The “Our Town” vision of local physicians serving local employers 7. <strong>Technology in practice</strong> — How transparent data changes physician-employer relationships</p>
<p><em>Format:</em> Personal stories and observations, not corporate messaging. 150-300 words per post. One key statistic or insight per post. End with a question or invitation to comment.</p>
<p><strong>Blog Posts (vxtrahealth.com/blog)</strong></p>
<p><em>Physician-targeted articles for SEO and sharing:</em></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>“Why 80% of Hospital-Employed Physicians Want to Go Back to Independent Practice”</li>
<li>“The Pre-Authorization Problem: How Insurance Companies Override Your Clinical Judgment”</li>
<li>“What Self-Insured Employers Actually Want from Their Physician Network”</li>
<li>“Physician Pay Has Dropped 33% Since 2001 — Here Is What Changed”</li>
<li>“Hospital Administrators Grew 2,500% While Physician Growth Stalled — The Numbers Behind the Shift”</li>
<li>“The Independent Physician’s Guide to Working with Self-Insured Employers”</li>
<li>“How Real-Time Claims Data Changes the Physician-Patient Relationship”</li>
<li>“From 30 to 100 Physicians: What Building a Practice Network Taught Us About Healthcare”</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Format:</em> 800-1,200 words. Data-driven. Solution-oriented (brief problem, heavy on what changes). Every post ends with a soft CTA to learn about the Vxtra network.</p>
<p><strong>Medical Conference Presence</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Georgia Medical Association Annual Meeting</li>
<li>Greater Augusta Medical Society events</li>
<li>Specialty-specific conferences (primary care, orthopedics, urology)</li>
<li>Larry attends as a speaker or panelist when possible (practice building, healthcare economics)</li>
<li>Not a booth vendor — a thought leader and conversation starter</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>FAQ Video Series (Physician Edition)</strong></p>
<p>Following the “They Ask You Answer” model from Marcus Sheridan, create short-form video content answering the questions physicians actually ask:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>“How does payment work in the Vxtra network?”</li>
<li>“Do I have to give up my other patients?”</li>
<li>“What does ‘no pre-authorizations’ actually mean in practice?”</li>
<li>“What technology do I need to install?”</li>
<li>“Who is Larry Hightower and why did he build this?”</li>
<li>“What happens if a patient needs care outside the network?”</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Format:</em> 2-3 minutes each. Larry on camera. Authentic, conversational. Each video becomes a blog post, email, LinkedIn post, and landing page embed.</p>

<h3 id="c5.-physician-onboarding-experience">C5. Physician Onboarding Experience</h3>
<p>Once a physician joins the network, the onboarding process should feel effortless. The entire value proposition is reducing administrative burden — onboarding must reflect that promise from Day 1.</p>
<p><strong>Onboarding Timeline: 4 Weeks</strong></p>
<p><strong>Week 1 — Welcome &amp; Technology Setup</strong> - Welcome call from Larry or Sandra (personal, not automated) - Assign dedicated onboarding contact from Vxtra operations team - Technology assessment: review existing practice management system - Capital Rx platform integration planning (compatibility check, data migration scope) - Provide login credentials and dashboard walkthrough</p>
<p><strong>Week 2 — Platform Training &amp; Configuration</strong> - 60-minute training session for physician and office staff - Dashboard overview: patient panel view, claims status, outcomes data - Practice management system integration goes live - Test claims submission and verify 30-day-or-less processing cycle - Configure patient routing preferences and scheduling</p>
<p><strong>Week 3 — Patient Panel Assignment</strong> - Employer patient lists loaded into system - Physician receives patient panel overview (demographics, basic history if available) - Care orchestration team introduction — meet the people who handle scheduling, referrals, follow-up - Verify referral pathways to other network physicians (specialists) - First patients can begin scheduling</p>
<p><strong>Week 4 — Go-Live &amp; Support</strong> - First Vxtra patients seen - Daily check-in with onboarding contact for first week of live patients - Rapid response support line for any claims, technology, or coordination issues - Feedback session at end of Week 4: what is working, what needs adjustment - Transition from onboarding contact to ongoing practice support team</p>
<p><strong>Ongoing Support:</strong> - Dedicated practice support contact (not a call center) - Quarterly data review: patient outcomes, panel growth, claims data - Technology updates and platform improvements communicated proactively - Care orchestration team available for complex case coordination</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="c6.-physician-retention-strategy">C6. Physician Retention Strategy</h3>
<p>Recruiting physicians is only half the challenge. Retaining them — and turning them into advocates — requires sustained engagement and visible results.</p>
<p><strong>1. Community of Practice</strong> Create a peer network among Vxtra physicians. Physicians who feel connected to other physicians in the network are significantly less likely to leave.</p>
<ul>
<li>Quarterly physician dinners in each market (informal, peer-to-peer, no sales pitch)</li>
<li>Private online forum or group (LinkedIn group or dedicated platform) for Vxtra physicians to share experiences, ask questions, and connect</li>
<li>Annual Vxtra Physician Summit (once network reaches 3+ markets) — thought leadership, practice management, networking</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Data-Driven Outcomes Reporting</strong> Physicians are scientists. Show them the data.</p>
<ul>
<li>Monthly practice dashboard: patient volume, claims processed, average resolution time</li>
<li>Quarterly outcomes report: patient satisfaction scores, treatment completion rates, preventive care metrics</li>
<li>Annual benchmarking: compare Vxtra network outcomes to regional and national averages</li>
<li>Transparency: physicians see the same data employers see — no hidden metrics</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Quarterly Physician Meetings</strong> Structured meetings in each market, every quarter.</p>
<ul>
<li>Review network performance data</li>
<li>Discuss patient care patterns and opportunities</li>
<li>Address any operational issues or improvement suggestions</li>
<li>Introduce new employers and projected patient panel growth</li>
<li>Guest speaker or educational component (CME-eligible when possible)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Peer Referral Recognition</strong> Physicians who refer other physicians to the network are acknowledged.</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal thank-you from Larry</li>
<li>Recognition at quarterly meetings</li>
<li>Priority consideration for new patient panel assignments</li>
<li>No financial incentive (inappropriate for physician relationships) — recognition and respect are the currency</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Administrative Burden Monitoring</strong> Track and actively reduce the administrative burden on Vxtra physicians compared to their traditional insurance experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>Quarterly survey: “How does working with Vxtra compare to working with [traditional insurer]?”</li>
<li>Track metrics: time from treatment decision to treatment delivery, claims processing speed, number of administrative interactions required per patient</li>
<li>Set improvement targets and report progress to physicians</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Practice Growth Support</strong> Help Vxtra physicians grow their practices through the network.</p>
<ul>
<li>As new employers join, expand physician patient panels</li>
<li>Provide market data on community healthcare needs and gaps</li>
<li>Facilitate connections between primary care physicians and specialists within the network</li>
<li>Support practice marketing to Vxtra employer employees (co-branded materials, directory listing)</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="c7.-key-messaging-by-specialty">C7. Key Messaging by Specialty</h3>
<p>Not all physicians have the same pain points. While the core message (autonomy, no pre-auths, independent practice) resonates universally, the emphasis should shift based on specialty.</p>
<p><strong>Primary Care (Family Medicine / Internal Medicine) — FIRST PRIORITY</strong></p>
<p><em>Primary pain point:</em> Volume pressure and administrative burden. Primary care physicians spend the most time on pre-authorizations because they manage the broadest range of conditions and referrals.</p>
<p><em>Key messages:</em> - “Spend more time with each patient — not on paperwork” - “Your referrals go directly to trusted local specialists — no insurance gatekeeper” - “Build a real panel of patients from local employers who stay with you long-term” - “Vxtra patients are not cycling through on 36-month insurance rotations — they are your community”</p>
<p><em>Pitch emphasis:</em> Patient relationships, reduced administrative burden, referral autonomy, stable patient panel from local employers.</p>
<p><strong>Orthopedics / Musculoskeletal — HIGH VALUE</strong></p>
<p><em>Primary pain point:</em> Pre-authorizations for imaging (MRI, CT) and surgical procedures. Step therapy protocols that force non-surgical treatment before approving what the physician already knows is necessary.</p>
<p><em>Key messages:</em> - “You determine when a patient needs an MRI — not an insurance reviewer” - “Independent orthopedic practice costs 40-70% less than hospital-based — Vxtra proves that to employers” - “No step therapy requirements dictating your treatment sequence”</p>
<p><em>Pitch emphasis:</em> Immediate clinical authority, cost advantage of independent practice, direct relationship with employer (who sees the cost savings).</p>
<p><strong>Cardiology — HIGH VALUE</strong></p>
<p><em>Primary pain point:</em> Diagnostic pre-authorizations (stress tests, echocardiograms, catheterizations) and medication pre-authorizations (newer cardiac medications frequently denied or delayed).</p>
<p><em>Key messages:</em> - “Order the diagnostic workup your patient needs — today” - “No prior authorization for cardiac imaging or stress testing” - “Transparent data means you see what your patients need and act immediately”</p>
<p><em>Pitch emphasis:</em> Speed of diagnostic decision-making, no delays in treatment, technology advantage (transparent data).</p>
<p><strong>OB/GYN — ESSENTIAL FOR FAMILIES</strong></p>
<p><em>Primary pain point:</em> Maternity care bundling and billing complexity, pre-authorization for procedures, and loss of continuity when patients change insurance plans mid-pregnancy.</p>
<p><em>Key messages:</em> - “Your patients stay with you through their entire care journey” - “No insurance plan changes disrupting continuity of care” - “Local employers want their employees to see physicians they trust for the most important moments”</p>
<p><em>Pitch emphasis:</em> Continuity of care, patient-physician trust, community connection.</p>
<p><strong>General Surgery — HIGH VALUE</strong></p>
<p><em>Primary pain point:</em> Pre-authorizations for surgical procedures, insurance-mandated delays, and cost pressure from hospital-based competitors.</p>
<p><em>Key messages:</em> - “You determine when surgery is appropriate — not an insurance algorithm” - “Your independent surgical practice is the cost-effective option — Vxtra helps employers see that” - “Faster path from diagnosis to treatment”</p>
<p><em>Pitch emphasis:</em> Surgical autonomy, cost advantage over hospital, faster treatment timelines.</p>
<p><strong>Urology — LARRY’S SPECIALTY</strong></p>
<p><em>Primary pain point:</em> Pre-authorizations for imaging and procedures, referral complexity, hospital consolidation pressure.</p>
<p><em>Key messages:</em> - “Larry built a urology practice from 30 to 100 physicians — he understands your world” - “The physician who built this network practiced in your specialty” - “Independent urology has a cost advantage — Vxtra makes that visible to employers”</p>
<p><em>Pitch emphasis:</em> Larry’s personal credibility, shared specialty understanding, cost transparency.</p>

<p><em>This document serves as the physician-facing component of the Vxtra Health StoryBrand Blueprint. All copy, strategy, and KPIs should be reviewed against the master BrandScript, messaging rules, and Cigna network constraint (Phase 1: no anti-insurer messaging until mid-2027). The physician landing page copy is ready for design and development. The marketing strategy activates upon Augusta market launch preparation (March 2026).</em></p>
