# Vxtra Health — Employee Deliverables

*Blueprint Section | Feb 11, 2026*
*Audience: Employee (End Beneficiary) — Onboarding & Activation*

---

## Important Context

Employees do NOT choose Vxtra Health. Their employer does. These deliverables are designed for **activation and adoption** — not sales. By the time an employee sees this content, the deal is done. The goal is to make them feel safe, welcomed, and eager to use their benefits.

**Tone:** Warm, simple, reassuring. Zero jargon. Low cognitive load. This person might be anxious about healthcare — make them feel like everything is going to be okay.

**Messaging rules:** Never use "provider" (always "physician" or "doctor"). Never say "healthcare is broken." No insurance jargon (EOB, TPA, PBM, CPT, stop-loss). Use dollar amounts, not percentages.

## SECTION A: Employee Landing Page Copy

*Full conversion-focused copy for a dedicated employee experience page/microsite. This page is accessed AFTER their employer has partnered with Vxtra. Purpose: onboarding, activation, and reassurance.*

### A1. Hero Section

**Section Label:** Welcome to Vxtra Health

**Headline:**
Your employer just gave you something incredible.

**Subheadline:**
Better healthcare. A real doctor who knows your name. And you never have to worry about the bill.

**CTA Button (Primary):** Meet Your Care Team
**CTA Button (Secondary):** See What You Get

---

### A2. Welcome / Problem Acknowledgment

**Section Label:** We Get It

**Headline:**
Healthcare has been confusing and expensive for way too long.

**Body Copy:**

Going to the doctor used to mean worrying about what it would cost. Sitting on hold with your insurance company. Getting a surprise bill six weeks later. Nobody should have to live like that.

Your employer partnered with Vxtra Health to change that — for you and your family.

With Vxtra, you get a personal physician, a dedicated care team, and benefits that actually work the way they should. No hoops. No runaround. Just care.

---

### A3. How It Works (For You)

**Section Label:** How It Works

**Headline:**
Three simple steps. That's it.

**Step 1: Get Connected to Your Physician**
We match you with a local doctor who gets to know you — not just your chart. This is your physician. They know your name, your history, and what matters to you.

**Step 2: Use Your Benefits Without Barriers**
No pre-authorizations. No surprise bills. No fighting with insurance. When you need care, you get care. It is that simple.

**Step 3: Get the Care You Need**
Whether it is a routine check-up, a specialist visit, or something unexpected — your care team handles the details so you can focus on feeling better.

**Closing line:**
That is the entire process. No fine print. No catch.

---

### A4. What You Get

**Section Label:** Your Benefits

**Headline:**
This is what your employer made possible.

**Value Stack:**

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **$0 Copays** | See your doctor without paying a dime at the door. Every visit. Every time. |
| **$0 Deductibles** | You do not have to spend a certain amount before your benefits kick in. They work from day one. |
| **A Doctor Who Knows You** | Not a random physician at a walk-in clinic. Your doctor. In your community. Someone who remembers your last visit. |
| **Personal Care Navigation** | Vxtra Care is your personal healthcare concierge. A real person — not a phone tree — who handles scheduling, referrals, and follow-ups for you. |
| **No Pre-Authorizations** | Your doctor decides what care you need. Not an insurance company. No waiting for approval. |
| **No Insurance Runaround** | No more sitting on hold for 45 minutes. No more getting bounced between departments. One call to Vxtra Care and it is handled. |

**Closing line:**
Your employer chose Vxtra Health because they believe you deserve better. This is what better looks like.

### A5. Vxtra Care Spotlight

**Section Label:** Vxtra Care

**Headline:**
After your appointment, we take it from here.

**Body Copy:**

Here is what usually happens after a doctor's visit: You leave with a list of things to do — schedule an X-ray, find a specialist, get blood work, fill a prescription. Then you are on your own to figure it all out.

Not anymore.

After your appointment, call Vxtra Care. Your personal nurse navigator handles everything:

- **Scheduling follow-ups** — so you do not have to call around
- **Coordinating specialists** — finding the right doctor and getting you in
- **Managing referrals** — no paperwork, no delays
- **Answering your questions** — about your care, your benefits, anything

You focus on getting better. We handle the rest.

**Callout Box:**
"Think of Vxtra Care as your personal healthcare assistant. One phone call, and your care team takes over."

**CTA:** Call Vxtra Care: [phone number]

---

### A6. Your Doctor

**Section Label:** Meet Your Physician

**Headline:**
A real doctor. In your community. Who actually knows you.

**Body Copy:**

Your Vxtra physician is not a voice on a telemedicine screen or a name on a rotating schedule. They are a local, independent doctor who chose to be part of the Vxtra network because they believe in this kind of care.

They practice in your community. They see you in person. They remember what you talked about last time. When you call their office, people know your name.

This is what healthcare used to feel like — and what it should feel like again.

**How you connect with your doctor:**
1. We will introduce you to your assigned physician when you activate your benefits
2. You will schedule your first visit (or Vxtra Care will do it for you)
3. From there, they are your doctor — call them when you need them

**CTA:** Meet Your Care Team

---

### A7. Frequently Asked Questions

**Section Label:** Questions? We Have Answers.

**Headline:**
Everything you want to know. Nothing confusing.

---

**Q: What does "$0 copay" really mean?**

It means exactly what it sounds like. When you visit your Vxtra physician, you pay nothing. Zero dollars. No bill at checkout, no bill in the mail. Your employer covers it through the Vxtra Health plan.

---

**Q: What if I need to see a specialist?**

Call Vxtra Care. Your nurse navigator will find the right specialist, schedule the appointment, and coordinate everything with your physician. You do not have to figure it out yourself.

---

**Q: What about emergencies?**

If you have a medical emergency, go to the emergency room. Vxtra Health covers emergency care. After you are stabilized, call Vxtra Care and your nurse navigator will coordinate any follow-up care you need.

---

**Q: How do I contact Vxtra Care?**

Call [Vxtra Care phone number] during business hours. A real person will answer — not an automated system. For non-urgent questions, you can also reach out through [portal/app details]. Response is the same day.

---

**Q: Can I keep my current doctor?**

If your current doctor is part of the Vxtra network, absolutely. If they are not currently in the network, let us know — we may be able to work with your physician to join. Either way, we will make sure you have a great doctor who is a good fit for you.

---

**Q: Does this cover my family too?**

Yes. Your Vxtra benefits extend to your covered dependents — your spouse and your children. They get the same $0 copays, $0 deductibles, and access to Vxtra Care. Same benefits, same care, same peace of mind.

---

### A8. Final CTA

**Headline:**
You deserve healthcare that works for you.

**Body Copy:**
Your employer chose Vxtra Health because they want you to get the care you need — without the stress, the confusion, or the cost. All you have to do is take the first step.

**CTA Button (Primary):** Meet Your Care Team
**CTA Button (Secondary):** Call Vxtra Care

**Closing Reassurance Line:**
No insurance jargon. No surprise bills. Just better care.

## SECTION B: Employee Page Wireframe

*Top-to-bottom wireframe for the employee onboarding/welcome page. Mobile-first. Warm, inviting, low cognitive load.*

---

### Design Philosophy

This is a **welcome page**, not a sales page. The visitor already has Vxtra benefits — they just need to understand them and feel good about using them. Every design decision should reduce anxiety and increase trust.

- **Mobile-first:** Most employees will access this from a link in a text or email on their phone
- **Low cognitive load:** Short sections, large type, ample white space
- **Photography:** Warm, diverse, real people. Avoid clinical/hospital stock photography. Show people smiling, in their community, at ease. Think: families at dinner, a person laughing with their doctor, a nurse on the phone helping someone
- **Color palette:** Use the established Vxtra brand — teal (#22BAB4) for trust/health, coral (#E8734A) for CTAs/warmth, dark ink (#1B2A3D) for text, warm white backgrounds
- **Typography:** DM Serif Display for headlines (warm, approachable serif). Inter for body (clean, highly readable)
- **Illustrations:** Minimal. Prefer real photography. If icons are needed, use simple line icons consistent with the main site

### Mobile-First Design Notes

1. **Breakpoints:** Design at 375px (mobile), scale up to 768px (tablet), then 1200px (desktop)
2. **Touch targets:** All buttons minimum 48px height, generous padding around tappable elements
3. **Typography scaling:** Headlines start at 28px mobile, scale to 48px desktop. Body stays 16-18px across all sizes.
4. **Images:** Use `aspect-ratio` or fixed heights on mobile so images do not dominate the viewport. Show enough to set mood, not so much it pushes content below the fold.
5. **CTAs:** On mobile, all CTA buttons go full-width and stack vertically with 12px gap
6. **Accordion FAQ:** Touch-optimized with generous hit areas and smooth expand/collapse animation
7. **Scroll behavior:** Smooth scroll with subtle reveal animations (consistent with main site: translate-up + fade-in on intersection)
8. **Load time:** Target under 3 seconds. Lazy-load images below the fold. Minimize custom fonts (DM Serif Display + Inter only).
9. **Accessibility:** All images need descriptive alt text. Color contrast meets WCAG AA. Focus states on all interactive elements.

---

### Photography Direction

**DO use:**
- Real people (not models when possible) in community settings
- Diverse representation — age, ethnicity, family structure
- Warm lighting, natural environments
- Doctor-patient interactions that feel personal (eye contact, conversation, not examination)
- Families together, people smiling naturally
- Community settings — local businesses, neighborhood feel
- A nurse on the phone with a warm expression (for Vxtra Care section)

**DO NOT use:**
- Clinical/sterile hospital imagery
- Stock photos with obvious artificial posing
- Stethoscope-around-the-neck cliches
- Sad/worried faces (this is a welcome page — energy should be positive)
- Complex medical equipment or operating rooms
- Generic corporate handshake photos

---

## SECTION C: Employee Engagement & Activation Strategy

*This is NOT a sales strategy. It is an activation and adoption strategy. Employees do not choose Vxtra — their employer does. The goal is to get employees to USE their benefits, build trust in the Vxtra Care concierge, and create long-term engagement that drives retention.*

---

### C1. Onboarding Funnel

The employee onboarding journey follows a linear path from announcement to ongoing engagement. Every step should reduce friction and increase confidence.

```
AWARENESS        ACTIVATION        FIRST USE        ENGAGEMENT
─────────────    ─────────────     ──────────       ──────────────
Employer         Employee          Schedules        Ongoing
announces new  → receives       → first          → relationship
benefit          welcome kit       appointment      with physician
                                                     + Vxtra Care
                 Activates         Meets their
                 account/portal    physician

                 Calls or is
                 called by
                 Vxtra Care
```

**Funnel Stages:**

| Stage | Trigger | Goal | Key Metric |
|-------|---------|------|------------|
| **1. Awareness** | Employer announces benefit change | Employee knows Vxtra exists and what it means for them | % of employees who attend/receive announcement |
| **2. Welcome** | Welcome kit delivered (digital + physical) | Employee understands their benefits and feels positive | Welcome kit open/engagement rate |
| **3. Activation** | Employee accesses portal or calls Vxtra Care | Employee is connected to their physician and care team | Activation rate (% who complete setup) |
| **4. First Use** | First appointment scheduled and attended | Employee experiences the benefit firsthand | Days-to-first-appointment |
| **5. Engagement** | Ongoing care, wellness, Vxtra Care utilization | Sustained usage and satisfaction | Quarterly utilization rate, NPS |

**Critical Transition: Awareness to Activation**

This is where most benefit programs lose people. The gap between "I heard about this" and "I actually signed up" is where confusion, inertia, and skepticism live. Close this gap with:
- **Immediate follow-up** — welcome kit arrives within 48 hours of announcement
- **Personal outreach** — Vxtra Care proactively calls each employee to introduce themselves
- **Simplicity** — activation requires 5 minutes or less (name, DOB, preferred contact — done)
- **Employer reinforcement** — HR sends 2-3 follow-up communications in the first 2 weeks

---

### C2. Welcome Email Campaign

A 5-email sequence delivered over 14 days, beginning the day the employee's Vxtra benefits become active. Each email should feel personal, warm, and short (under 200 words). Subject lines should be conversational, not corporate.

---

**Email 1: Welcome (Day 0 — Benefits Activation Day)**

- **Subject:** Welcome to Vxtra Health — here is what just changed for you
- **Purpose:** Introduction and excitement
- **Content:**
  - Your employer partnered with Vxtra Health
  - What this means: $0 copays, $0 deductibles, a doctor who knows you
  - One simple next step
- **CTA:** "Meet Your Care Team" (links to employee landing page)
- **Tone:** Warm, congratulatory, simple

---

**Email 2: Meet Your Doctor (Day 3)**

- **Subject:** Let us introduce you to your doctor
- **Purpose:** Make the physician relationship tangible
- **Content:**
  - Your Vxtra physician is local and independent
  - They chose to be part of this network
  - They will know your name, not just your chart
  - How to schedule your first visit
- **CTA:** "Schedule Your First Visit" or "Call Vxtra Care to Get Started"
- **Tone:** Personal, reassuring

---

**Email 3: Meet Vxtra Care (Day 7)**

- **Subject:** You have a personal healthcare team now — here is how to reach them
- **Purpose:** Introduce the care concierge and drive awareness
- **Content:**
  - What Vxtra Care does (scheduling, referrals, coordination, questions)
  - When to call (after appointments, when you need a specialist, anytime you are unsure)
  - It is a real person, not a phone tree
  - Save this number in your phone: [Vxtra Care number]
- **CTA:** "Save Vxtra Care's Number"
- **Tone:** Helpful, practical

---

**Email 4: Your Benefits at a Glance (Day 10)**

- **Subject:** Quick reference — everything your Vxtra plan covers
- **Purpose:** Provide a benefits summary they can save/screenshot
- **Content:**
  - Visual card/infographic: $0 copays, $0 deductibles, no pre-auth, personal navigation
  - What to do in different scenarios (routine visit, specialist, emergency, prescription)
  - Link to FAQ page
- **CTA:** "Bookmark Your Benefits Page"
- **Tone:** Clear, reference-style

---

**Email 5: First Appointment Reminder (Day 14)**

- **Subject:** Have you scheduled your first visit yet?
- **Purpose:** Nudge toward first appointment (the most critical activation milestone)
- **Content:**
  - Gentle reminder — your doctor is ready to see you
  - If you have not scheduled yet, Vxtra Care can do it for you — just call
  - Brief story/testimonial: "When [name] went for their first visit, they could not believe how easy it was."
  - Reinforce: this is not a chore, this is a benefit
- **CTA:** "Schedule Now" or "Call Vxtra Care"
- **Tone:** Encouraging, no pressure

---

### C3. Activation Tactics

Multiple touchpoints to drive activation, because different people respond to different channels. The goal is unavoidable awareness with zero annoyance.

---

**Welcome Packet (Physical + Digital)**

*Physical:*
- Delivered to the employee's home address (not just workplace) within 1 week of benefit activation
- Contents: Welcome letter from Vxtra, benefits summary card (wallet-sized), Vxtra Care phone number magnet (refrigerator-worthy), physician information sheet, quick-start guide (1 page, large print)
- Design: Clean, warm, branded. Feels premium — not junk mail. Consider a soft-touch envelope or branded folder.
- Include a handwritten-style note: "Welcome to Vxtra Health. We are glad you are here."

*Digital:*
- PDF versions of all physical materials available on employee portal
- Mobile-optimized benefits card (can be saved to phone wallet)
- Digital welcome video (60-90 seconds, featuring Vxtra Care team introducing themselves)

---

**Benefits Fair Presence**

- Attend employer-hosted open enrollment events and benefits fairs
- Staff with Vxtra Care team members (the same people employees will call)
- Hands-on demo: walk employees through a mock Vxtra Care call
- Provide printed materials + QR code to the employee landing page
- Answer questions in real-time — remove anxiety on the spot
- Have a "schedule your first appointment" station where Vxtra Care books visits live

---

**On-Site Enrollment Sessions**

- Schedule 2-3 sessions at the employer's workplace during the first 2 weeks
- 30-minute format: 15-minute presentation + 15-minute Q&A
- Led by Vxtra Care nurse navigators (builds familiarity before first call)
- Cover: what changed, what you get, how to use Vxtra Care, how to see your doctor
- Record sessions and make available for employees who could not attend
- Provide snacks and a relaxed atmosphere — this should not feel like a corporate mandate

---

**Employer Champion Program**

- Identify 3-5 employees per company who are enthusiastic about the benefit change
- These "Vxtra Champions" act as peer advocates within the workplace
- Provide them with:
  - Early access to benefits (if possible) so they have a firsthand story to tell
  - Talking points (not a script — conversational bullet points)
  - Branded swag (Vxtra t-shirt, water bottle — things that start conversations)
  - Direct line to Vxtra Care for any questions their peers bring to them
- Champions are not salespeople. They are trusted colleagues who can say: "I already used it and here is what happened."
- Incentive: Recognition, small gift cards, or wellness credits

---

### C4. Vxtra Care Adoption Strategy

Vxtra Care is the single most differentiated feature for employees. If they use it once, they will use it again. The challenge is getting that first interaction.

---

**Awareness Campaigns**

- **"After Your Appointment" Campaign:** Every employee interaction should end with a reminder to call Vxtra Care. Physician offices display Vxtra Care signage. After-visit text/email: "Need help with follow-ups? Call Vxtra Care at [number]."
- **Scenario-Based Messaging:** Short, relatable examples pushed via email and workplace posters:
  - "Need a specialist? Call Vxtra Care."
  - "Confused about a prescription? Call Vxtra Care."
  - "Doctor told you to get blood work? Call Vxtra Care — they will schedule it."
- **Workplace Signage:** Posters in break rooms, bathrooms, near HR — simple design with Vxtra Care number and one sentence: "One call. We handle the rest."

---

**First-Use Program**

- After an employee's first appointment, Vxtra Care proactively calls them (not the other way around) to:
  - Ask how the visit went
  - Offer to handle any follow-ups
  - Make sure they know how to reach Vxtra Care in the future
- This proactive outreach is critical — it demonstrates the value before the employee has to seek it out
- Track first-use conversion: What % of employees who see their doctor then engage Vxtra Care within 7 days?

---

**Satisfaction Surveys**

- Brief (3-5 question) survey after first Vxtra Care interaction:
  - "How easy was it to reach us?"
  - "Did we resolve what you needed?"
  - "Would you call Vxtra Care again?"
  - "What could we do better?"
- Use responses to refine the service and generate testimonials (with permission)
- Share aggregate satisfaction scores with employers as proof of value

---

### C5. Ongoing Engagement

After activation, maintain a steady presence in the employee's life — not overwhelming, but consistent enough that Vxtra stays top-of-mind when they need care.

---

**Wellness Content (Monthly)**
- Monthly email or portal content focused on practical health topics
- Seasonal relevance: flu season prep, summer safety, back-to-school physicals, mental health awareness
- Format: Short (under 300 words), actionable, ties back to "talk to your doctor" or "call Vxtra Care"
- NOT generic newsletter content — personalized to the local community when possible (e.g., "Allergy season in Augusta starts early this year")

---

**Seasonal Health Reminders (Quarterly)**
- Q1: Annual physical/wellness check-up reminder
- Q2: Summer health prep (hydration, outdoor safety, children's sports physicals)
- Q3: Back-to-school (immunizations, pediatric check-ups)
- Q4: Flu shots, year-end benefits utilization reminder, mental health check-in

---

**Annual Check-Up Campaign**
- Proactive campaign 30 days before employee's benefit anniversary
- Vxtra Care calls to schedule annual check-up if one has not been completed
- Messaging: "It has been a year. Let us make sure everything is on track."
- For employees who have not seen their doctor in 6+ months, a gentle nudge: "Your physician is here for you. Even a check-in visit matters."

---

**Satisfaction Surveys (Bi-Annual)**
- Comprehensive survey at 6-month and 12-month marks
- Measure: overall satisfaction, Vxtra Care experience, physician relationship quality, likelihood to recommend to a friend, comparison to previous insurance experience
- Share results with employer as part of quarterly business reviews
- Use employee quotes (with permission) as testimonials for future onboarding

---

### C6. Employer as Channel

The employer's HR team and benefits administrators are the most trusted communication channel to employees. Equip them to amplify Vxtra messaging without requiring them to become Vxtra experts.

---

**Employer Enablement Kit**

Provide each partnered employer with a ready-to-use communications toolkit:

| Asset | Format | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Announcement Email Template** | Editable email (HTML + plain text) | HR sends to all employees when Vxtra launches |
| **Follow-Up Email Templates (x3)** | Editable emails | HR sends at 1 week, 2 weeks, and 1 month post-launch |
| **FAQ Sheet** | PDF (1 page, print-ready) | For HR to distribute or post in break rooms |
| **Poster (Break Room)** | PDF (11x17, print-ready) | "Your New Benefits Are Here" — with Vxtra Care number |
| **Poster (Bathroom)** | PDF (8.5x11, print-ready) | "Need help after a doctor's visit? Call Vxtra Care." |
| **Benefits Fair Table Display** | PDF (retractable banner spec) | For open enrollment events and benefits fairs |
| **Manager Talking Points** | PDF (1 page) | For managers/supervisors to answer basic questions |
| **Announcement Script** | Word doc | For HR to read at all-hands meetings or town halls |
| **Digital Assets** | PNG/JPG files | Vxtra-branded images for company intranet, Slack, Teams |
| **Welcome Video** | MP4 + embed link | 60-90 second welcome video HR can share via email or intranet |

---

**HR Champion Playbook**

A short guide (3-5 pages) for the HR/benefits team that covers:
1. What Vxtra Health is (in plain language they can repeat)
2. The top 10 questions employees will ask — and the answers
3. When to direct employees to Vxtra Care vs. handling internally
4. How to track adoption (what metrics Vxtra provides back to them)
5. Monthly touchpoints: what Vxtra sends, what HR should reinforce

---

**Ongoing Employer Communication**

- Monthly report to HR: activation rate, utilization rate, Vxtra Care usage, satisfaction scores
- Quarterly business review with employer leadership: ROI, employee feedback, care patterns, recommendations
- Annual comprehensive review: total cost of care, employee health trends, retention correlation, renewal recommendation

---

### C7. Success Metrics

Measure what matters. Every metric ties back to the question: "Are employees actually using and benefiting from Vxtra Health?"

---

**Primary Metrics**

| Metric | Definition | Target | Measurement |
|--------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Activation Rate** | % of eligible employees who complete onboarding setup | 85% within 30 days | Portal/enrollment data |
| **First Appointment Rate** | % of activated employees who schedule and attend first physician visit | 70% within 60 days | Scheduling + claims data |
| **Vxtra Care Utilization** | % of employees who contact Vxtra Care at least once | 50% within 90 days | Call/contact logs |
| **Employee NPS** | Net Promoter Score — would you recommend this to a friend? | 50+ (excellent) | Bi-annual survey |
| **Care Avoidance Reduction** | Decrease in employees who report avoiding care due to cost | 40% reduction in Year 1 | Annual survey comparison |

---

**Secondary Metrics**

| Metric | Definition | Why It Matters |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| **Days to First Appointment** | Average days from activation to first doctor visit | Shorter = better engagement. Target: under 30 days. |
| **Vxtra Care Repeat Usage** | % of employees who call Vxtra Care more than once | Indicates trust and perceived value. Target: 60%+ of first-time users. |
| **Welcome Email Engagement** | Open rates and click-through rates on the 5-email sequence | Measures whether messaging resonates. Target: 50%+ open rate. |
| **Employer Champion Referrals** | Number of employees who cite a peer as their reason for activating | Measures word-of-mouth effectiveness. |
| **Satisfaction Trend** | NPS and satisfaction scores tracked over time | Scores should increase quarter over quarter in Year 1. |

---

**Reporting Cadence**

| Report | Audience | Frequency | Contents |
|--------|----------|-----------|----------|
| Activation Dashboard | Vxtra internal team | Weekly | Real-time activation, scheduling, Vxtra Care call volume |
| Employer Report | HR / benefits team | Monthly | Activation rate, utilization, satisfaction, Vxtra Care highlights |
| Executive Summary | Employer leadership | Quarterly | ROI, cost trends, employee feedback, retention data, recommendations |
| Annual Review | Employer C-suite + Vxtra leadership | Annually | Full-year outcomes, benchmarking, renewal recommendation |

---

### C8. Retention Focus

**The benchmark:** Traditional insurance companies retain members for 36-42 months on average. Vxtra's goal is to significantly exceed this through relationship-based care and the Vxtra Care concierge — building loyalty that commodity insurance cannot match.

---

**Why Vxtra Should Retain Longer**

Traditional insurance is transactional. Employees have no relationship with their insurer. When the employer switches plans, employees feel nothing — because there was nothing to feel.

Vxtra is relational. The employee has:
- A physician who knows them by name
- A nurse navigator who has helped them schedule appointments and coordinate care
- A history of $0 bills and no runaround
- Trust built through repeated positive experiences

Switching away from Vxtra means losing those relationships. That is a powerful retention mechanism — not because of lock-in, but because of genuine value.

---

**Retention Strategy: Employee Side**

1. **Deepen the physician relationship** — Encourage annual wellness visits, proactive check-ins, and continuity of care. The longer the doctor-patient relationship, the harder it is to walk away.

2. **Vxtra Care as the stickiness layer** — Every interaction with Vxtra Care builds switching cost. Not financial switching cost — emotional switching cost. "Who is going to schedule my specialist visits if I lose Vxtra Care?"

3. **Celebrate milestones** — One-year anniversary email: "You have been with Vxtra for a year. Here is what we did together: 4 doctor visits, 2 specialist referrals coordinated by Vxtra Care, $0 out of pocket." Make the value tangible and personal.

4. **Collect and share stories** — Employee testimonials (with permission) create social proof. "I never used to go to the doctor. Now I actually look forward to my check-ups." These stories reinforce the community feeling and become tools for employer retention conversations.

5. **Anticipate renewal season** — 90 days before the employer's renewal decision, proactively reach out to employees with a satisfaction survey. Share aggregate results with the employer. Let employee sentiment be the most powerful renewal argument.

---

**Retention Strategy: Employer Side (Employee-Driven)**

The strongest argument for employer renewal is employee satisfaction. Structure reporting to make this undeniable:

- **"What your employees are saying"** — Include anonymized employee quotes in every quarterly review
- **Utilization proof** — "87% of your employees have seen their physician. 62% have used Vxtra Care. Your previous plan had 41% utilization."

**The Long Game**

Vxtra's retention advantage is not a gimmick or a contract clause. It is the natural result of a system that actually works for people. When someone has a doctor who knows them, a care team that handles the hard parts, and $0 bills — they do not want to go back to the old way.

The employee becomes Vxtra's most powerful advocate at renewal time. Not because anyone asked them to. Because they mean it.
