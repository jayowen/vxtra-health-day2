<h3 id="fractional-cmo-recommendation">Fractional CMO Recommendation</h3>
<p><strong>We recommend a fractional CMO / marketing partnership model over a full-time marketing hire for the first 12-18 months.</strong> Here is why:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Cost efficiency.</strong> A full-time VP of Marketing or CMO costs $150K-$250K+ in salary and benefits. A fractional engagement delivers senior strategic leadership at a fraction of that cost — critical when working capital is $2M and every dollar needs to drive toward 500 enrolled employees.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Immediate capability.</strong> There is no 3-month ramp-up period. Business Builders already has full context from the StoryBrand workshop, understands the messaging, knows the personas, and has the production team ready to execute. Day one is productive.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Full team, not one person.</strong> A fractional model through Business Builders provides a strategist, designer, developer, copywriter, and video coordinator — not a single marketing generalist trying to do everything alone.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Flexibility.</strong> As Vxtra grows and funding scales (private placement $3.5M in Q3, additional markets in 2027), the engagement can scale up or transition to an in-house hire supported by the agency. The fractional model bridges the gap.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sandra’s bandwidth.</strong> Larry acknowledged that Sandra is running full-time operations and no one on the Vxtra team is dedicated to marketing. A fractional partner handles execution so the Vxtra team can focus on what they do best — building the health plan and serving employers.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The right time to evaluate a full-time marketing hire is after Augusta has proven the model (Q1 2027) and Gainesville launch planning demands dedicated in-house coordination.</p>
