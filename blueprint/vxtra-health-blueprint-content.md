# Business Growth System

**Prepared for Vxtra Health**
February 10–11, 2026

Business Builders × Vxtra Health | St. Augustine, FL

---

# Executive Summary

**Workshop Overview**

Over two days in St. Augustine, FL, the Vxtra Health leadership team and Business Builders worked through a comprehensive StoryBrand Blueprint workshop, identifying audiences, defining the villain, building messaging frameworks, and creating the strategic foundation for all future marketing.

## The StoryBrand 7-Part Framework

Character → Problem → Guide → Plan → CTA → Failure / Success

## The Villain

**Health insurance companies**

> "Health insurance companies have hijacked healthcare and make it very difficult for doctors and nurses to do what they do best."
>
> — Larry Hightower

## Four Audiences Identified

| Hero | Audience | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| Hero #1 | **Employers** | CEO or HR leader, 200–2,000 employees. Want transparent costs and a better experience for everyone. |
| Hero #2 | **Brokers** | Independent benefits advisors. Want a product the competition can't match. |
| Enabler | **Physicians** | Want their agency restored. Buried in pre-authorizations and insurance bureaucracy. |
| Beneficiary | **Employees** | The end beneficiary. Want care without fear, confusion, or financial stress. |

## Key Strategic Decisions

| Area | Decision |
|------|----------|
| **Positioning** | Vxtra owns the problem of **health insurance costs + terrible experience**, not "healthcare is broken." |
| **Go-To-Market** | Employers are the primary hero. Brokers are the gateway. |
| **Primary CTA** | **"Schedule a Call"** for employers and brokers. **"Join the Network"** for physicians. |
| **Core Differentiator** | The "Our Town" model: local employers + local physicians + Fortune 100 technology, in secondary markets. |

## Messaging Rules

### Always Say

- **"Physician"** or **"Doctor"**: never "provider"
- "Educate without offending"
- Dollar amounts, not percentages
- "Our money" (not "my money")
- "Avoidable cost" (not fraud/waste)

### Never Say

- **"Provider"**: "They're not providers. They're physicians."
- **"Healthcare is broken"**: the problem is how it's paid for
- Insurance jargon (EOB, TPA, PBM, NADAC)
- High cognitive load sentences

---

# ICP #1: The Employer

**Self-Funded, 200–2,000 Employees**

## Employer Messaging Framework

### Character

A CEO or HR leader in a company with 200 to 2,000 employees.

**Want:** Transparent costs and a better experience for everyone.

### Problem

- **External:** Health insurance costs too much and the experience is terrible for everyone
- **Internal:** Trapped, frustrated, and powerless
- **Philosophical:** "It's just plain wrong that it's so expensive and the experience is so bad for everyone."

### Guide

- **Empathy:** "We know how frustrating the entire insurance industry can be."
- **Authority:** Decades of experience on both sides of the table. 30+ years delivering healthcare and financing it. Fortune 100 technology, transparent data.

### Plan

1. Schedule a conversation
2. See what you qualify for
3. Be free from the chains of traditional insurance options

**CTA:** "Schedule a Call"

### Failure

- Costs compound year over year in all the wrong ways
- Top talent leaves (68% cite benefits)
- Employees miss more work due to inefficient health insurance
- No one is happy with the experience of using their health insurance when they really need it

### Success

- Predictable, lower costs
- Transparent data
- Hire and retain top talent

### Transformation

From trapped → Free. From dreading renewal season → Confident in predictable costs. From powerless → Leading the change.

## One-Liner

> Health insurance costs are increasing at an unsustainable rate, leaving employers feeling trapped. Vxtra Health provides a way out with a tech-forward platform that connects with the best local physicians to achieve predictable costs and better outcomes.

## StoryBrand Soundbites

**P — Problem**
"Health insurance costs are crushing your business."

**E — Empathy**
"You shouldn't have to choose between taking care of your people and protecting your bottom line."

**A — Answer**
"Vxtra Health gives your company access to the same healthcare technology and drug pricing that only Fortune 100 companies have had, with transparent data, local physicians, and costs you can actually track and control."

**C — Change**
"Be the reason your company finally has health insurance it can be proud of."

**E — End Result**
"Your employees get better care from physicians they trust, your costs become predictable and your data becomes transparent."

## Explanatory Paragraph

Health insurance costs keep going up, the experience keeps getting worse, and you're left feeling like there's nothing you can do about it. You're not alone, and it doesn't have to be this way.

Vxtra Health is a new kind of health plan, built from the ground up around the employer, the employee, and the physician. Our model connects your company with the best local physicians and transparent pricing, so you always know what you're paying and who's taking care of your people.

The process is simple:

1. Schedule a conversation
2. See what you qualify for
3. Experience health insurance that actually works

Schedule a call today, and find out if Vxtra is the right fit for your company.

# ICP #2: The Broker

**Benefits Advisor**

## Broker Messaging Framework

### Character

A broker selling the same networks and products as everyone else.

**Want:** A product the competition can't match.

### Problem

- **External:** It's hard to stand out when every broker is selling the same plans
- **Internal:** Replaceable
- **Philosophical:** Innovative brokers should be able to compete and win

### Guide

- **Empathy:** "It's exhausting trying to stand out with the same products as everyone else."
- **Authority:** 30+ years of industry experience. Access to Fortune 100 technology, more transparent data, local and personal care orchestration for employees.

### Plan

1. Have a conversation
2. Get exclusive plan access
3. Retain and win new clients

**CTA:** "Schedule a Call"

### Failure

- Lose clients
- Limited differentiation
- Revenue stagnates
- Another agency could share Vxtra first

### Success

- A product no competitor can match
- Existing business secured
- New business pipeline full
- An improved experience for all

### Transformation

From competing with the same products → Offering something no one else has. From vulnerable → Successfully scalable.

## One-Liner

> Brokers are all selling the same thing. Vxtra Health offers a plan built around the employer, the employee, and the physician, with transparent costs and a better experience for everyone.

## StoryBrand Soundbites

**P — Problem**
"It's hard to differentiate yourself in the marketplace. Everyone is selling the same thing."

**E — Empathy**
"It's exhausting trying to stand out when you're selling the same solutions as every other broker in town."

**A — Answer**
"Vxtra Health gives you a transparent health plan backed by Fortune 100 technology that your competitors don't have access to."

**C — Change**
"Be the broker who brings something nobody else can offer."

**E — End Result**
"Your clients save real money, your book of business is protected, and employers come to you because you're the one with the plan that actually works."

## Explanatory Paragraph

You already know the problem. Every broker in town is quoting the same carriers, offering the same networks, and hoping the renewal doesn't go sideways. It's exhausting, and it makes you replaceable.

We built Vxtra Health because we believe brokers deserve a better option to bring to the table. Our plan is designed around the employer, the employee, and the physician, backed by the same technology that Fortune 100 companies use, with transparent costs and care that's actually coordinated locally.

The process is simple:

1. Have a conversation
2. Get exclusive plan access
3. Retain and win new clients

Schedule a call today. Before another broker in your market does.

# ICP #3: The Physician

**Independent Physicians & Practice Owners**

## Physician Messaging Framework

### Character

A physician buried in pre-authorizations and insurance bureaucracy.

**Want:** Practice medicine instead of insurance.

### Problem

- **External:** Insurance companies control clinical decisions
- **Internal:** Frustrated and demoralized
- **Philosophical:** Physicians should practice medicine, not fight insurance companies

### Guide

- **Empathy:** "You didn't spend a decade in training to fight pre-auth forms."
- **Authority:** 30+ years on both sides of healthcare. Building physician practices and financing health plans. Backed by Fortune 100 technology that handles the data so you can focus on patients.

### Plan

1. Join the Vxtra network
2. Work directly with local employers
3. Practice medicine your way

**CTA:** "Join the Network"

### Failure

- More pre-authorizations
- Less autonomy
- 80% of hospital-employed physicians want out

### Success

- Agency restored
- Community-centered care
- Independent practice in a community that knows your name

### Transformation

From fighting insurance bureaucracy → Making clinical decisions. From losing independence → Running your own practice.

## One-Liner

> Insurance companies control how you practice medicine. Vxtra Health removes them from the equation, connecting you directly with local employers while technology handles the data. You treat patients your way, in a community that knows your name.

## StoryBrand Soundbites

**P — Problem**
"Insurance companies are practicing medicine for you."

**E — Empathy**
"You didn't spend a decade in training to fight pre-authorization forms and get told how to treat your own patients by someone who's never seen them."

**A — Answer**
"Vxtra Health puts physicians, not insurance companies, back in charge of patient care. You work directly with local employers and their employees, supported by technology that handles the claims and data so you can focus on medicine."

**C — Change**
"Practice medicine the way you always intended to."

**E — End Result**
"Your patients trust you, not a call center. You make the clinical decisions. And you run a practice in a community that knows your name."

# ICP #4: The Employee

**End Beneficiary**

## Employee Messaging Framework

### Character

An employee who dreads going to the doctor because of cost.

**Want:** High quality healthcare without the worry of a denied claim.

### Problem

- **External:** Healthcare is confusing and way too expensive
- **Internal:** Anxious and frustrated
- **Philosophical:** Everyone deserves affordable, accessible care

### Guide

- **Empathy:** "Nobody should dread going to the doctor because they're afraid of what it'll cost."
- **Authority:** A new way to do health insurance with the best local physicians, in your town, backed by Fortune 100 technology.

### Plan

1. Ask your employer about Vxtra Health
2. Use your benefits without barriers
3. Get the care you need

**CTA:** "See the Benefits"

### Failure

- Avoids care out of fear
- Small problems become emergencies
- Dreads every bill

### Success

- $0 copays, $0 deductibles
- A real relationship with their doctor
- Care without dread

### Transformation

From avoiding care due to cost → Getting the care they need. From dreading the bill → Never worrying about it.

## One-Liner

> Healthcare is confusing and too expensive, and most people dread going to the doctor because of what it might cost. Your employer partnered with Vxtra Health to give you local doctors who know you, with lower costs and no insurance runaround. You call your doctor, you get seen, you get the care you need, and you don't dread the bill.

## StoryBrand Soundbites

**P — Problem**
"Healthcare is confusing and way too expensive."

**E — Empathy**
"Nobody should dread going to the doctor because they're afraid of what it'll cost."

**A — Answer**
"Your employer has partnered with Vxtra Health to connect you with local physicians who actually know you, with lower out-of-pocket costs and none of the insurance runaround."

**C — Change**
"Be someone who actually uses their healthcare, without the stress."

**E — End Result**
"You call your doctor, you get an appointment, you get the care you need, and you don't dread opening the bill."
