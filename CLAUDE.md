---

## StoryBrand Framework (Day 1 Output)

### CHARACTER (Heroes)

1. **Brokers** (First Hero) — Gateway to employers. Want: differentiation, protect existing business, win new business. "I can secure my existing business with a new product and keep the competition out."
2. **Employers** (Second Hero) — Self-funded, 200-2,000 employees, secondary markets. Want: lower costs, hero status to board/employees, real-time data. "Your job is to make me the hero to my board."
3. **Physicians** (Enablers, NOT heroes) — Want agency back. "They want agency back. But they're so proud that they've lost it."
4. **Employees** (Ultimate beneficiaries) — Better care, navigation, $0 copays/deductibles, no pre-auth.

### VILLAIN

**Health insurance companies** — Blue Cross, United, Cigna, Aetna.

> "Health insurance companies have hijacked healthcare and make it very difficult for doctors and nurses to do what they do best." — Larry Hightower

### PROBLEM

- **External:** Health insurance costs too much, experience is terrible
- **Internal:** Employers feel out of control every renewal cycle; brokers have zero differentiation; physicians lost agency
- **Philosophical:** Every company deserves Fortune 100 benefits

### GUIDE (Empathy + Authority)

- **Empathy:** "We know the industry. We've been through it." Sandra and Larry on all sides: employer, physician, broker, operations.
- **Authority:** Larry's track record (22x, 15x exits), Sandra's 30+ years, Capital Rx partnership, Tokyo Marine HCC investment

### PLAN

1. Have a discovery conversation
2. Get a custom plan design (Capital Rx technology + local physician network)
3. Experience better healthcare with real-time data and orchestrated care

### SUCCESS

- Employers: Predictable lower costs, hero to board/employees, real-time data
- Brokers: Differentiation, secured existing business, new revenue without more FTEs
- Physicians: Agency restored, less insurance interference
- Employees: Better care, personal navigation, $0 copays/$0 deductibles

### FAILURE

- Costs compound (7-10% annual, doubling in a decade)
- Best employees leave (68% cite benefits as top factor)
- Care quality declines
- Insurance status quo continues extracting value (1,600% stock appreciation in 8 years)

---

## The "Our Town" Model (Core Differentiator)

Vxtra aggregates self-funded employers within a secondary market into a collective risk pool, partnered with local independent physicians, powered by Capital Rx technology.

**How it works:**
1. Identify secondary/B market where influencers are connected
2. Find Top 5 physician influencers (independent doctors)
3. Aggregate self-funded employers into a larger pool for better stop-loss pricing
4. Partner with local independent physicians (same treatment costs 40-70% less vs. hospital)
5. Capital Rx provides real-time data, NADAC prescription pricing, Judi claims processing
6. Tokyo Marine HCC provides stop-loss reinsurance at better rates
7. Brokers are the channel partners who bring employers to the table

**Why secondary markets:** "The dots are closer together" — everyone knows everyone. Brand equity already exists in the community.

---

## Capital Rx Partnership

- **Technology:** Fortune 100-level tools now available to mid-market employers
- **Judi Platform:** First to process BOTH prescription and medical claims together
- **NADAC Pricing:** Lowest available drug prices (dynamic, transparent)
- **Data Speed:** 7-day data vs. 120-day delay from traditional insurers
- **IPO Plans:** Capital Rx plans to go public 2027
- **Mid-Market Exclusive:** Vxtra is first to bring Fortune 100 tools to 200-2,000 employee market

## Messaging Rules

### ALWAYS Use
- "Physician" or "doctor" (NEVER "provider")
- "Employee benefits for self-funded middle-market employers in secondary markets"
- "Educate without offending"
- "Agency" (for physicians)
- "Our money" (not "my money" when employer talks to employees)
- "Avoidable cost" (not fraud, not waste)
- "Our Town" (marketplace concept)
- "People like us do things like this" (Seth Godin — community messaging)
- **Dollar amounts, not percentages** — "$25 per employee per month" > "25% savings"

### NEVER Use
- **"Provider"** — Larry: "They're not freaking providers. They're physicians." Historical parallel to stripping professional identity.
- **"Healthcare is broken"** — "We'll never say healthcare is broken." The problem is how healthcare is PAID FOR and ADMINISTERED.
- **"It's Just Better"** — Rejected tagline. Not clear enough.
- **Insurance jargon** on customer-facing materials (EOB, TPA, PBM, CPT, NADAC, stop-loss, captive)
- **High cognitive load** sentences — "The lower the cognitive load, the more people place orders."
- **Excessive problem-dwelling** — Per John Rossman: "Quit talking about the problem."

### Brand Voice
- Educational, empathetic, servant-leadership oriented
- Clear, not clever
- Low cognitive load
- Professional but conversational
- Confident without being aggressive
- Solution-oriented (brief problem, heavy on solution/vision)
- Warm, community-driven ("Our Town")
- Zero jargon on customer-facing materials

---

## PEACE Framework (Sound Bites — To Be Drafted Day 2)

**P** = Problem — What gets their attention
**E** = Empathy — Show you understand their struggle
**A** = Answer — Position product as the solution
**C** = Change — The transformation / who they become
**E** = End Result — Their happily ever after / brand promise

*Jay will draft PEACE sound bites overnight for Day 2 workshop.*

---

---

## Target Market

- **Geography:** Secondary/B markets (Augusta, Gainesville, Chattanooga, Florence SC, Greenville SC, etc.)
- **Company Size:** 200-2,000 employees, self-funded
- **85,000** self-funded employers nationally in this range
- **Market Population:** ~50K-250K (secondary/B markets)
- **Key Selection Criteria:** Concentrated population, strong independent physician presence (40-45%), identifiable physician influencers, known employer base, existing broker relationships
- **Chain of Trust:** Capital Rx → Vxtra → Broker → Employer → Physician
- **Change Management:** "Even when the solution is better, switching is scary. Need to make it feel easy/low-risk."
- **Startup Mentality:** "Clinical trial" approach — prove concept in pilot markets before scaling

---

## Broker Strategy

- Brokers are the GATEWAY to employers
- NOT being replaced — maintaining advisory relationship and compensation
- Motivated by: differentiation, protecting existing business from PE-backed competitors, new revenue
- 3-year contracts, 40% upfront commissions
- Target: Independent legacy agencies (NOT PE-owned)
- Key partner: Norton/Blanchard Calhoun (merged $50M agencies, backed by Broad Street Capital)

---

## Funding Timeline

| Source | Amount | Date |
|--------|--------|------|
| Capital Rx | TBD | March 1, 2026 |
| Earn-out advance | ~$1M | June 30, 2026 |
| Working capital total | $2M | For initial market launches |
| Private placement | $3.5M | Q3 2026 (after proving market) |

---

## Competitive Landscape

- **Insurance Bukas (BCBS, United, Cigna, Aetna):** Legacy tech (120-day data delays), misaligned incentives, administrative-only role for self-funded
- **PE-Owned Brokers (60%):** Won't innovate, riding to earn-out
- **Captives:** Require employer capital upfront; Vxtra offers same risk-pooling via Tokyo Marine without capital requirement
- **Hospital Systems:** Buying up specialists, 40-70% higher costs; Vxtra partners with independents

## Day 2 Morning Session (Feb 11, 2026)

### Headline & Positioning (Confirmed)
- **Headline:** "Health insurance costs are crushing your business. We built a way out."
- Vxtra owns the problem of **health insurance costs + terrible experience** (not "healthcare is broken")
- Primary CTA: **"Schedule a Call"**
- Alternative CTA: **"Get a Free Analysis"** (using census data)

### Cigna Network Constraint (CRITICAL)
- **Phase 1 (now through mid-2027):** Must work WITHIN existing Cigna network in Augusta
  - CANNOT aggressively attack insurance companies in messaging yet
  - Risk: Cigna could cut off network access if Vxtra is seen as adversarial
  - Messaging must be pro-employer/pro-transparency, NOT anti-insurer
- **Phase 2 (mid-2027+):** Transition to proprietary networks
  - Can then shift to stronger anti-insurance-company messaging
- Capital Rx creating market "wake" with Fortune 100 announcements (Apple, GM partnerships coming)

### Website Strategy
- Two-track approach needed:
  1. **Augusta & Gainesville visitors** → direct to local brokers
  2. **Outside markets** → general consultation / interest capture
- **Minimal lovable product** approach — launch quickly, iterate monthly
- Remove insider jargon — keep language clear, low cognitive load

### Marketing Materials & Timeline
| Milestone | Date |
|-----------|------|
| March 1 preparation begins | March 1, 2026 |
| Website refreshed with clear messaging | By April 2026 |
| Single sales sheet for brokers | By April 2026 |
| Educational presentation deck (civic groups) | By April 2026 |
| Brand story video for website | By April 2026 |
| Go-live (first employers on system) | July 1, 2026 |
| 500 employees on system | October 1, 2026 |

### Broker Readiness
- Two key brokers at **8/10 readiness** in Augusta and Gainesville
- Challenge: Explaining "how" Vxtra works without revealing competitive secrets
- Solution: Focus on **outcomes and capabilities**, not operational details
- Brokers will provide curated client lists meeting criteria

### Success Metrics & Pipeline
- **6-month goal:** 10 letters of intent (Augusta)
- **12-month goal:** Letters of intent from both markets for Jan 1, 2027 renewals
- **Threshold:** 5,000+ covered lives triggers underwriting advantages
- **Tracking:** HubSpot with automated follow-up sequences

### "Our Town" Model — Simplified Messaging
- Prevents revenue leakage to Atlanta/larger markets
- Leverages existing local medical capabilities
- Simple version: "Vxtra Health connects employers with the best local doctors in your community — powered by the same technology Fortune 100 companies use"

### Design Preferences (Quiz Results from Morning Session)
- **Preferred styles:** Minimalist, Modern, Flat, Image-Focused, Corporate
- **Rejected styles:** Illustrative, Hand-drawn, Retro, Bold/Maximalist
- Larry gravitated toward: clean layouts, dark backgrounds, flat design, real photography
- Corporate but approachable — NOT playful, NOT edgy
- Think: Apple-style simplicity with medical credibility

### Capital Rx "Wake" Strategy
- Capital Rx creating massive market buzz in 2026 with Fortune 100 client announcements
- **Apple** and **General Motors** partnerships coming — will be widely publicized
- Larry: "We're behind the wake of Capital Rx" — ride the awareness they're creating
- This validates the technology story without Vxtra having to prove it independently
- Capital Rx IPO planned for 2027 — more visibility coming

### Broker Details (Augusta & Gainesville)
- **Kelly** — Lead broker in Augusta, ready at 8/10, has done 1.5 years groundwork with Salem
- **Salem** — Kelly's partner, co-leading Augusta broker recruitment
- **Bart** — Broker in Gainesville market
- **Sam** — Broker in Gainesville, **former 2-term mayor of Gainesville** — significant community influence
- Kelly's approach: bring multiple employers to the table at once (not one-by-one)
- Brokers already doing informal selling — "I already told three people about this"

### Video & Content Strategy (Morning Session)
- **Existing Vxtra video:** Currently on site, reviewed in session — belongs in "enlightenment" phase (NOT curiosity/awareness)
- **FAQ Video Series:** Top 12+ questions, 2-3 min each, Marcus Sheridan "They Ask You Answer" model
- Each video generates: blog post + newsletter + social content + email sequence
- **LinkedIn Strategy:** Larry's personal LinkedIn is the primary content channel initially
  - Larry has significant network of healthcare executives
  - Personal thought leadership > company page (especially for startup)
- **Remarketing Campaign:** Retarget website visitors with educational content
  - Low cost, high impact for early-stage awareness
  - Tag visitors, serve follow-up ads across platforms

### HubSpot Status
- Vxtra **already using HubSpot** — confirmed in morning session
- Needs optimization/cleanup for the new marketing push
- Will serve as primary CRM for tracking broker/employer pipeline
- Automated follow-up sequences planned for post-CTA submissions

### Day 2 Meeting Recordings
- Morning: https://notes.granola.ai/t/b6511a56-fa95-4511-9af2-2238f9a6e856
- Afternoon: https://notes.granola.ai/t/5563f3bf-8886-4cdf-ae0f-0d53d6240469

## Day 2 Afternoon Session — BrandScript Development (Feb 11, 2026)

### Employer BrandScript (Finalized)
- **Character:** Self-insured employer tired of renewal shock, paying more every year for less
- **External Problem:** Health insurance costs too much and the experience is terrible for everyone
- **Internal Feeling:** Trapped, frustrated, and powerless every renewal cycle
- **Philosophical:** "It's just plain wrong that it's so expensive and the experience is so bad for everyone."
- **Empathy:** "We know how frustrating the entire insurance industry can be."
- **Authority:** Decades on both sides of the table — 30+ years delivering healthcare and financing it
- **Plan:** 1. Schedule a conversation → 2. See what you qualify for → 3. Be free from the chains of traditional insurance options
- **Failure:** Costs compound year over year; top talent leaves; employees miss work; no one is happy with the experience
- **Success:** Predictable lower costs; transparent data; hire and retain top talent
- **Transformation:** From trapped → Free

### Qualification Criteria (Step 2 Tool)
- Minimum **100+ people** on plan required
- **Self-insured for 2+ years**
- Census data collection (no personal details needed)
- Interactive qualification tool planned for website

### Employer One-Liner (Finalized)
> Health insurance costs are increasing at an unsustainable rate, leaving employers feeling trapped. Vxtra Health provides a way out with a tech-forward platform that connects with the best local physicians to achieve predictable costs that employees love.

### Employer Explanatory Paragraph (StoryBrand Template)
> At Vxtra Health, we know you want to be the leader who finally fixed health insurance for your company. In order to do that, you need predictable costs, transparent data, and benefits your employees actually love. The problem is health insurance costs are crushing your business and the experience is terrible for everyone, which makes you feel trapped, frustrated, and powerless every renewal cycle. We believe it's just plain wrong that it's so expensive and the experience is so bad for everyone. We understand how frustrating the entire insurance industry can be, which is why we built a way out.
>
> Here's how we do it: 1. Schedule a conversation 2. See what you qualify for 3. Be free from the chains of traditional insurance options
>
> So, schedule a call today. And in the meantime, stop watching costs compound year over year while your best people walk out the door. So you can stop feeling powerless and instead have health insurance everyone actually loves.

### Broker BrandScript (Finalized)
- **Character:** Independent broker selling the same networks and products as everyone else
- **Want:** A product the competition can't match
- **External Problem:** Every health plan looks the same
- **Internal Feeling:** Invisible and replaceable
- **Philosophical:** Innovative brokers should be able to compete and win
- **Empathy:** "It's exhausting trying to stand out with the same solutions as every other broker in town."
- **Authority:** Access to Fortune 100 technology, more transparent data, local and personal care orchestration for employees
- **Plan:** 1. Have a conversation → 2. Get exclusive plan access → 3. Retain and win new clients
- **Failure:** Lose clients; limited differentiation; revenue stagnates; another agency could share Vxtra first
- **Success:** A product no competitor can match; existing business secured; new business pipeline full
- **Transformation:** From vulnerable → Successfully scalable

### Broker One-Liner (Finalized)
> Every broker is selling the same networks and the same products. Vxtra Health provides a new pathway to differentiate with a better health insurance option for self-funded clients. Lower costs, a better experience for everyone, and more transparency across the board.

### "Our Town" Model — Additional Details
- Requires critical mass of **20-30 employers** to launch effectively in a market
- Local coalition approach for group purchasing power — essentially a **GPO (Group Purchasing Organization)**
- Scalable market-by-market methodology — replicate benchmark from Augusta/Gainesville to new markets
- Visual: Vxtra at center connecting employers, brokers, physicians
- **"Dancing Guy" analogy:** First employer is the leader, second one validates, then momentum builds naturally — brokers will facilitate this peer-to-peer (golf course introductions, owner-to-owner)
- Brokers (specifically Kelly in Augusta) plan to bring **multiple clients to the table at once** — not one-by-one
- Jay Richie (stop-loss underwriting) needs to see collective volume to back the program
- **Whole Foods precedent:** Previously carved out local networks when better than national carrier — same model can apply once Vxtra has traction with initial employers
- **Home Depot example:** 4 Home Depots in Augusta market = 8 stores × ~350 employees = potential pathway to 5,000 lives by going upstream after proving concept downstream
- Once operating metrics are proven, large national employers with local presence can join the Our Town network

### PEACE Framework (Website Copy Structure — Employer)
- **P (Problem):** "Health insurance costs are crushing your business."
- **E (Empathy):** "You shouldn't have to choose between taking care of your people and protecting your bottom line."
- **A (Answer):** Access to Fortune 100 healthcare technology and drug pricing — with transparent data, local physicians, and costs you can actually track and control
- **C (Change):** "Become the leader who finally fixed health insurance for your company."
- **E (End Result):** "Your employees get better care from physicians they trust, your costs become predictable and your data becomes transparent."

### Vxtra Care (Care Orchestration Service)
- **Concierge/care orchestration service** for employees — a key differentiator
- Think of it as a personal nurse navigator: employee leaves doctor with follow-up tasks (X-rays, blood work, specialist referrals) → calls Vxtra Care → nurse handles all scheduling and coordination
- **Revenue flow for Vxtra** — not just a feature, it's a product line
- Unheard of in current insurance market — insurance companies try to save themselves money, not help patients navigate care
- **Messaging approach:** Don't over-explain the "how" — mention it as a value stack item, let them learn more ("Don't tell them how to build the watch")
- Could be a **second PEACE framework** focused on employee experience (vs. the cost-focused employer one)

### "Local" Messaging Caution
- **Do NOT over-emphasize "local"** — risk of triggering "narrow network" fears
- People react negatively to feeling confined: "Oh, I can't go anywhere else"
- Instead: emphasize **"the best doctors"** and **quality** without specifying geographic limits
- If someone needs Mayo Clinic, they can go to Mayo Clinic — that's the thread to communicate
- Language: "the best local physicians" (not "only local physicians")

### Point Solution Fatigue (Broker Context)
- Current broker model: cobble together separate vendors for each cost center (orthopedic, maternity, psychology, etc.)
- Each vendor has own database, call center, reports — creates fragmentation
- Like having to call a different company for every device plugged into your computer
- When something breaks, everyone points fingers: "That's not our problem"
- Vxtra solves this by consolidating under one umbrella

### Multiple PEACE Frameworks Strategy
- Each PEACE framework addresses **one specific problem**
- Employer PEACE #1 (built): "Health insurance costs are crushing your business" (cost-focused)
- Employer PEACE #2 (future): "Nobody's happy with the health insurance experience" (experience-focused)
- Broker PEACE (built): "It's hard to differentiate yourself in the marketplace"
- Salespeople should have **10+ PEACE frameworks** addressing different problems — multiple doors into the house

### Key People (From Transcript)
- **Kelly** — Key broker in Augusta, leading client recruitment efforts
- **Salem** — Broker partner (Kelly and Salem together have done 1.5 years of groundwork)
- **Jay Richie** — Stop-loss underwriting contact, needs to see collective volume
- **Bart** — Contributing to broker recruitment alongside Jay Richie
- **Tim** — Joined Day 2 virtually, new to the team/advisory
- **Mark Bailey** — Broker in Jacksonville, FL, potential future market target (Jay knows him from United Way board)

### Larry's Mindset & Concerns (From Transcript)
- "This is literally all I do. All I think about." — Fully consumed by this venture
- Biggest concern post-workshop: **"How do we stay a good client?"** — Aware that Sandra has full-time ops work, nobody on their team is dedicated full-time to marketing
- Larry acknowledges: "We've got too much inside baseball with 25 years of experience with the old way" — needs help simplifying
- Values arguing/tension in meetings: "It's good to argue about it" — healthy disagreement is welcome
- Two more rounds of financing expected — CMO hire possible then if needed

### Next Steps & Follow-Up
- Jay to clean up and refine all brand messaging documents
- **Schedule follow-up Zoom presentation (1 hour) in 1-2 weeks**
- Send deliverables ahead of time so team can review before call
- Present near-final versions of all deliverables
- Outline next phase marketing partnership recommendations:
  - Timeline, costs, expected outcomes
  - Team involvement structure
  - 12-month engagement plan
- **Fractional CMO approach** recommended rather than full-time hire initially
- Collect internal/external notes during October transition for case study material
