## Shared Villain

**Health insurance companies** (Blue Cross, United, Cigna, Aetna). They have hijacked healthcare, built systems designed to maximize their own profits, and made it nearly impossible for employers to take care of their people or for physicians to practice medicine.

> "Health insurance companies have hijacked healthcare and make it very difficult for doctors and nurses to do what they do best." - Larry Hightower

### Character
A CEO or HR leader in a company with 200 to 2,000 employees.

### Problem

- **Authority:** Decades of experience on both sides of the table. 30+ years delivering healthcare and financing it. Fortune 100 technology, transparent data.

**What they want:** A product the competition can't match.

### Problem
- **External:** It's hard to stand out when every broker is selling the same plans
- **Internal:** Replaceable
- **Philosophical:** Innovative brokers should be able to compete and win

### Guide
- **Empathy:** "It's exhausting trying to stand out with the same solutions as every other broker in town."

## 3. THE PHYSICIAN

### Character
A physician buried in pre-authorizations, denials, and insurance bureaucracy, spending more time fighting paperwork than practicing medicine.

**What they want:** Practice medicine instead of insurance.

### Problem
- **External:** Insurance companies control clinical decisions
- **Internal:** Frustrated and demoralized
- **Philosophical:** Physicians should practice medicine, not fight insurance companies

### Guide
- **Empathy:** "You didn't spend a decade in training to fight pre-auth forms."
- **Authority:** 30+ years on both sides of healthcare. Building physician practices and financing health plans. Backed by Fortune 100 technology that handles the data so you can focus on patients.

### Plan
1. Join the Vxtra network
2. Work directly with local employers
3. Practice medicine your way

**CTA:** "Join the Network"

### Failure
- More pre-authorizations, less autonomy
- 80% of hospital-employed physicians want out

### Success
- Agency restored
- Community-centered care
- Independent practice in a community that knows your name

### Transformation
From fighting insurance bureaucracy → Making clinical decisions. From losing independence → Running your own practice.

**What they want:** High quality healthcare without the worry of a denied claim.

### Problem

- **Philosophical:** Everyone deserves affordable, accessible care

### Guide
