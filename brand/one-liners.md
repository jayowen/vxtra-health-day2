# Vxtra Health: One-Liners

*Finalized Feb 11, 2026 | Day 2 Workshop*

---

## What Is a One-Liner?

A single, repeatable statement that flows naturally in conversation. Memorizable, conversational, usable everywhere: business cards, email signatures, elevator pitches, website headers, social bios.

---

## 1. THE EMPLOYER

Health insurance costs are increasing at an unsustainable rate, leaving employers feeling trapped. Vxtra Health provides a way out with a tech-forward platform that connects with the best local physicians to achieve predictable costs and better outcomes.

---

## 2. THE BROKER

Brokers are all selling the same thing. Vxtra Health offers a plan built around the employer, the employee, and the physician, with transparent costs and a better experience for everyone.

---

## 3. THE PHYSICIAN

Insurance companies control how you practice medicine. Vxtra Health removes them from the equation, connecting you directly with local employers while technology handles the data. You treat patients your way, in a community that knows your name.

---

## 4. THE EMPLOYEE

Healthcare is confusing and too expensive, and most people dread going to the doctor because of what it might cost. Your employer partnered with Vxtra Health to give you local doctors who know you, with lower costs and no insurance runaround. You call your doctor, you get seen, you get the care you need, and you don't dread the bill.

## Testing Criteria

1. Does it pass the "grunt test"? (Could a caveman understand it?)
2. Does it make the customer the hero?
3. Does it avoid banned language? (No "provider," no "broken," no jargon)
4. Could Larry say it naturally in conversation?
5. Could a broker repeat it to an employer?
6. Does it create curiosity? (Makes someone say "tell me more")
7. Is it under 30 seconds when spoken aloud?
