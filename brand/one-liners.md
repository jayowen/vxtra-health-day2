# Vxtra Health — One-Liners

*Finalized Feb 10, 2026 — For Day 2 Workshop (Feb 11)*
*Format: Problem, Solution, Outcome*

## What Is a One-Liner?

A single, repeatable statement with three parts:
1. **Problem** — The pain your customer faces
2. **Solution** — What Vxtra does about it
3. **Outcome** — The result they experience

Memorizable, conversational, usable everywhere: business cards, email signatures, elevator pitches, website headers, social bios.

## 1. THE EMPLOYER

**Problem:** Most employers pay more every year for health plans designed for insurance company profits — not their people.

**Solution:** Vxtra Health gives self-insured employers a physician-led health plan with Fortune 100 technology, local doctors, and real-time cost visibility.

**Outcome:** Your employees get better care. Your costs drop by hundreds per employee per month. And you become the leader who finally fixed healthcare.

## 2. THE BROKER

**Problem:** Every broker is selling the same carriers and the same products — with no way to stand out.

**Solution:** Vxtra Health gives independent brokers an exclusive physician-led health plan that no competitor can offer.

**Outcome:** Your clients save real money. Your book of business is protected. And employers come to you first.

## 3. THE PHYSICIAN

**Problem:** Insurance companies decide how you treat your patients — through pre-authorizations, denials, and endless paperwork.

**Solution:** Vxtra Health puts physicians back in charge, working directly with local employers while technology handles the rest.

**Outcome:** You make the clinical decisions. Your patients trust you. And you run an independent practice in a community that knows your name.

## 4. THE EMPLOYEE

**Problem:** Healthcare is confusing and too expensive. Most people dread going to the doctor because of what it might cost.

**Solution:** Your employer partnered with Vxtra Health to give you local doctors who know you — with lower costs and no insurance runaround.

**Outcome:** You call your doctor. You get seen. You get the care you need. And you don't dread the bill.

## Testing Criteria (Day 2 Workshop)

1. Does it pass the "grunt test"? (Could a caveman understand it?)
2. Does it make the customer the hero?
3. Does it avoid banned language? (No "provider," no "broken," no jargon)
4. Could Larry say it naturally in conversation?
5. Could a broker repeat it to an employer?
6. Does it create curiosity? (Makes someone say "tell me more")
7. Is it under 30 seconds when spoken aloud?
