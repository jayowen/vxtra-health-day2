## The Opportunity

Vxtra Health is preparing to launch its first market in Augusta, GA on July 1, 2026, with Gainesville, GA following in early 2027. This proposal outlines three engagement options for the marketing infrastructure, sales enablement, and ongoing content engine required to support broker-led employer acquisition and reach 5,000+ covered lives within 12 months.

All three plans build on the StoryBrand Blueprint work completed February 10–11, 2026.

## Our Recommendation

The **Target Plan at $17,000/mo** is calibrated to deliver everything in the 12-month marketing plan we built together during the Blueprint sessions. It gives Vxtra the full content engine, sales enablement stack, digital infrastructure, and Fractional CMO leadership needed to reach 5,000 covered lives — without requiring a full-time marketing hire.

The Minimum plan gets you launched but leaves strategy, paid media, and several high-impact deliverables on the table. The Accelerated plan compresses timelines and adds volume for teams that want to move faster.
