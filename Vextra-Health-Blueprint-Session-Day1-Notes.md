## 1. Company Overview: Vextra Health

**What it is:** A healthcare startup (~8-year venture, 15 years of research) building a tech-enabled, physician-led health insurance alternative for self-funded employers in secondary/B-markets (populations ~50K–250K).

**Core thesis:** Health insurance companies have "hijacked healthcare," making it too expensive and creating a terrible experience. Vextra Health removes the legacy insurance middleman model and replaces it with a local, physician-driven, tech-enabled health plan for self-funded employers.

**Key differentiator:** Vextra partners with **Capital Rx** (pharmacy benefit tech company that went from $12.8M pre-money in 2019 to $3.58B in 2025) to access Fortune-100-level technology, real-time claims data, and NADAC drug pricing — tools that were previously unavailable to small/mid-market employers.

**Technology platform:** Capital Rx's platform "JUDI" — first-in-nation to process both prescription AND medical claims on a single platform. Provides real-time data (vs. industry standard 120-day lag).

## 2. Market Strategy

### Target Markets (in order)
| Market | Launch | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Augusta, GA | July 2026 | Prospects lined up, broker partners onboard |
| Gainesville, GA | July 2027 | Early planning stage |

### Go-To-Market Approach: "Our Town" Model
- **Niche down** into secondary markets where physician influence is concentrated
- Leverage the "law of large numbers" by aggregating self-funded employers (goal: 5,000 employee lives per market)
- Use existing broker relationships (not replace brokers) — brokers shift their book of business to Vextra's health plan
- Broker partner: A large general agency (Marsh-like entity) with $50M+ premium that covers 24+ markets in the Southeast

### Stakeholder Map (Multi-Sided Marketplace)
| Stakeholder | Role | Motivation |
|------------|------|------------|
| **Physicians** | Anchor/influencer — the trust layer | Want agency back; frustrated with insurance bureaucracy |
| **Employers (C-Suite)** | Customer — writes the check | Lower costs, better experience for employees, less friction |
| **Brokers** | Channel partner — brings employers | Differentiation, new revenue, protect existing book |
| **Employees** | End beneficiary | Better care, less friction, lower out-of-pocket |
| **Hospitals** | Competitor/co-exist | Currently absorbing physician practices; Vextra keeps physicians independent |
| **Stop-Loss Carrier (Tokyo Marine HCC)** | Risk partner | Aggregated pool = better underwriting; lower marketing cost per customer |

### Sequencing
1. **First sell the broker** — they already have employer relationships
2. **Then the employer** — broker brings them in; Vextra provides tools they've never had
3. **Then the physicians** — they become the "second sell" and long-term differentiator
4. **Hospitals as observers** — their employed physicians actually want to be independent again (80% per Larry's estimate)

## 3. Funding & Budget

| Source | Amount | Timing |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Capital Rx marketing loan | ~$1M | By March 2026 |
| Earn-out advance (from prior company sale) | ~$1M | By March 2026 |
| **Total working capital** | **~$2M** | Q1 2026 |
| Private placement raise | $3.5M | Q3 2026 (after pilot proof) |

## 4. Key Problems Identified (From a Messaging Perspective)

### The Villain
- **Health insurance companies** (United, Cigna, etc.) — universally hated by all stakeholders
- The villain is well-established; no need to spend time building the case

### The Core Problems
- **Too expensive** — everyone knows it, everyone agrees
- **Experience is terrible** — 120-day data lag, pre-authorization friction, faceless bureaucracy
- **No transparency** — employers don't see contracts, don't get timely data, don't know actual costs
- **Physicians stripped of agency** — called "providers" instead of physicians, forced into protocol compliance by non-specialists

### The Messaging Challenge
- Multi-sided marketplace = different messages for different stakeholders
- Deep insider jargon ("inside baseball") that must be eliminated
- The team naturally goes deep into weeds — need to **keep it simple**
- Larry's board advisor (John Rossman, author of *Think Like Amazon*): "Larry, keep it simple. Please."

## 5. StoryBrand Framework Workshop (Jay's Teaching)

Jay walked the team through the full **StoryBrand 7-Part Framework**:

1. **Character** (Customer) — The employer/broker, NOT Vextra Health
2. **Problem** — External (too expensive, bad experience), Internal (frustrated, overwhelmed, out of control), Philosophical ("it's just plain wrong that...")
3. **Guide** (Vextra) — Shows empathy + authority
4. **Plan** — Three simple steps max (not 50)
5. **Call to Action** — Clear, direct ask
6. **Success** — Vision of what winning looks like
7. **Failure** — Consequences of doing nothing (status quo)

### New Addition: StoryBrand Sound Bites (PEACE Framework)
Don Miller's newest framework for creating front-facing messaging:
- **P** — Problem (gets attention)
- **E** — Empathy (creates bond)
- **A** — Answer (positions product as solution)
- **C** — Change (personal transformation)
- **E** — End Result (vision of brighter future)

### Three Phases of Customer Journey
1. **Curiosity** — Stop and pay attention (the "front steps")
2. **Enlightenment** — Build trust and understanding (the "front porch")
3. **Commitment** — Buy / take action (the "front door")

## 6. Key Strategic Insights from Discussion

- **Don't sell on the problem** — Everyone already knows it. Sell the solution.
- **Don't use insurance jargon** — Ever. With anyone. Larry's rule: "No insurance terminology."
- **Physicians are called physicians, not "providers"** — This is a deliberate and important distinction for Vextra's brand.
- **The change management barrier is real** — Even when the solution is better, switching is scary. Need to make it feel easy/low-risk.
- **Capital Rx is a trust proxy** — "We can get you access to the kinds of resources that only Fortune 100 companies have."
- **The broker is also a trust proxy** — Chain of trust: Capital Rx → Vextra → Broker → Employer → Physician
- **Use dollar amounts, not percentages** — "25% savings" means nothing. "$25 per employee per month" does.
- **This is a startup** — Must prove concept in pilot markets before scaling. Clinical trial mentality.
- **Timing is ideal** — Political pressure on health insurance, Senate Finance Committee hearings, Trump administration targeting insurance/pharma, public anger at its peak.

## 7. AI Discussion Highlights

- Larry used ChatGPT at 6:50am to create his entire $1M funding document with charts — would have taken a team weeks
- Jay shared: built 319 AI applications in the past year, leverages AI agents extensively
- Team discussed Claude 4.5/4.6 as the model that convinced real software engineers AI can write production code
- Consensus: AI will reduce FTEs by ~40%, but human relationships and discernment remain irreplaceable
- Jay's philosophy: "The future is highly autonomous AND deeply human — both at the same time"
