## Content Engine: The Multiplication Model

Every major content piece generates multiple assets:

```
1 FAQ Video (2-3 min)
  → 1 Blog Post (transcript + expanded)
  → 2-3 LinkedIn Posts (key quotes, clips)
  → 1 Email Newsletter Feature
  → 1 Social Media Clip (30-60 sec)
  → Sales team talking point
```

**12 FAQ videos = 60+ content pieces** across channels.

### Proposed FAQ Video Topics

*"They Ask, You Answer" approach — answer what employers, brokers, and HR leaders are already searching for. Vxtra becomes the answer within each topic.*

**Cost & Savings**
1. "Why does my company's health insurance go up every year?"
2. "How much does self-funded health insurance actually cost?"
3. "What's the real difference between fully insured and self-funded?"
4. "Can small and mid-size companies actually save money on health insurance?"

**How It Works**
5. "What does a health plan with $0 copays and $0 deductibles look like?"
6. "How do employer-sponsored health plans work with local doctors?"
7. "What is stop-loss insurance and why does it matter for self-funded employers?"
8. "How long does it take to switch health insurance plans for my company?"

**Decision-Making**
9. "How do I know if self-funding is right for my company?"
10. "What should I ask my insurance broker at renewal time?"
11. "What data should I have access to from my health plan?"
12. "Why are so many employers leaving traditional insurance carriers?"

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Cigna network dependency (through mid-2027) | Keep messaging pro-employer/pro-transparency, not anti-insurer |
| Slow employer adoption | "Dancing guy" strategy — first 2-3 employers create social proof; broker peer introductions |
| Broker capacity constraints | Expand broker network beyond Kelly/Salem; provide strong sales tools so brokers need less hand-holding |
| Larry as single spokesperson | Begin developing Sandra and broker voices as secondary content creators |
| Capital Rx IPO timing shifts | Decouple Vxtra messaging from Capital Rx timeline; build independent brand credibility |
| Physician recruitment resistance | Lean on physician influencers; frame as autonomy restoration, not sales pitch |
